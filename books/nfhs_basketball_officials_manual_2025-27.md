2025-27 Mechanics Changes
SCORER & TIMER
FOUL
REPORT FOUL
Center opposite calls foul on offense, no free throws
In three-official mechanics, when a foul is called on the offense by the Center opposite
the table and there are no free throws, the Center reports the foul and moves across the
court and becomes Center tableside. The old Lead moves across the court to administer
the ensuing throw-in and becomes the new Trail. The old Trail moves across the court and
becomes the new Lead.

MECHANICS CHANGES
Signal Change
Flopping Signal 15 – This signal, approved prior
to the 2024-25 season, should be used when a
player attempts to fool an official into believing a
foul has occurred.
Both arms are upright toward the chest at a 90
degree angle and move down fully extended.
The motion should only happen one time and
should be the first signal given when reported to
the table.
SCORER & TIMER
FOUL
REPORT FOUL
Trail calls backcourt foul on defense, no free throws
In three-official mechanics, when the Trail official on the tableside calls a foul in the
backcourt and no free throws are awarded, there is no switch of positions. The Trail reports
the foul, stays in the same position (tableside Trail), and administers the throw-in. The
Center (opposite side) and the Lead (tableside) also remain in their current positions.

# Part 1: Officiating Principles

## 1.1 Basketball Officiating

### 1.1.1 Purpose of Rules

The basketball rules allow two teams to play so that neither
team has an unfair advantage. The role of officials is to enforce the rules. Mechanics
are the necessary tool that place officials in the proper position to enforce the rules and
communicate infractions. This manual is written with those purposes in mind. The rules
book and manual are the constant to which everyone has access. Officials should enforce
the rules as written and follow the manual as written.

### 1.1.2 Game Officials

Game officials are responsible for creating public confidence in
sports and are critical to the well-being of athletic competitions. Officials ensure games
are played fairly, by the rules, within the spirit of the rules and in a safe manner. Officiating
takes a great deal of preparation, continuing education and commitment of time. This is
facilitated through the registration, promotion and training programs available to officials
through the NFHS and state associations.

### 1.1.3 Rules Knowledge

Complete knowledge of the rules is essential. To know the
rules thoroughly requires constant and analytical study. Rules should be studied before the
opening of the season and continuously reviewed throughout the season. For educational
purposes, the following aids are helpful: rules book, case book, simplified and illustrated
rules, handbook, preseason guides, Part I and II examinations, officiating mechanics exam,
interpretations, PowerPoint presentations, video play review, discussion at state-sponsored
and local meetings, clinics and periodic releases by the state association office. Good
officiating is dependent on a thorough knowledge of the basketball rules.

### 1.1.4 Language

The language of basketball must be fully understood, such as: bonus
free throws, common foul, double foul, fumble, multiple throw and many other terms as
found in the definitions. The technical meaning of “team in control” and understanding of
technicalities such as when “continuous-motion” provisions apply are essential. The same
thing applies to a clear and definite understanding of exactly when the ball becomes dead
and when an act such as a dribble or a free throw ends. The definitions portion (Rule 4) of
the NFHS Basketball Rules Book should be thoroughly studied.

### 1.1.5 Signals

Knowledge of the rules alone does not ensure competency. Understanding
and using approved signals and mechanics are necessary to administer the game. Proper
NFHS signals, as outlined in this manual and the rules book, are to be used exclusively.
Signaling is an essential aspect of officiating and, through proper use, decisions and
information are relayed to players, coaches and spectators. These official signals are
informative and meaningful. Clear signals establish the understanding that the officials are
in control of the game.

### 1.1.6 Proper Court Coverage

A good system of mechanics is required to ensure the
officials will be at the proper location on the court at all times. The movements must be
such that an official moves with a purpose to monitor activity within the defined primary
coverage area. An official who is not in the proper position on the court decreases the
opportunity to make the accurate rulings. Officials must be proficient in good officiating
mechanics.

### 1.1.7 Players’ Welfare

Officials should be alert constantly to the possibility of player
injury. Injured players should be attended to as outlined in the rules. In all situations, the
welfare of an injured player has the highest priority.

## 1.2 Personal Characteristics

### 1.2.1 Conduct

Every member of the officiating profession carries a responsibility to
act in a manner becoming of a professional person. The conduct of any official influences
the attitude of the public toward the profession in general, as well as toward the official as
an individual. Officials should constantly uphold the honor and dignity of officiating in all
personal conduct and relations with student-athletes, coaches, athletic directors, school
administrators and the public. Officials are entrusted to assist schools in the educational
development of youth through athletics. Professionalism and politeness allow for an official
to be independent, impartial and responsible to the people being serve. Officials should
review the NFHS Officials Code of Ethics at the end of this manual, as well as in the NFHS
Basketball Rules Book.

### 1.2.2 Communication

Communication is vital to being a successful official.
Understanding non-verbal and verbal communication sends a message to players, coaches
and fans. Good communication starts with accepting game assignments, contacting game
administration prior to the contest and working with the table officials in preparing to start
the game. During the contest, officials must communicate with their partners, coaches
and players in a positive, professional manner. Officials must be aware of their non-verbal
communication cues and body language. Officials shall not address fans and must refrain
from derogatory comments.

### 1.2.3 Conditioning

Basketball requires a well-conditioned body and an alert mind. A
physical examination should be taken at the start of each season and after any illness or
injury that occurs during a season. Unless an official is in good physical condition, reaction
time and the ability to concentrate in making decisions will be less than satisfactory. Hustle
and energy have no substitutes. An official must develop the ability to move quickly and
purposefully, and be in position to observe all game action.

### 1.2.4 Composure

During a game, if a head coach asks what happened on a certain
play, your explanation should be the extent of the conversation; do not argue or lose your
temper with a player or head coach. A diplomatic manner will foster positive interaction.
Being tactful in responses encourages a cooperative attitude on the part of players, coaches
and spectators. Tactfulness is a talent that will pay dividends in officiating. It is not desirable
to be demonstrative when making a ruling. It is not the officiating, but the game that is
the attraction. An official should not be overbearing, but perform as an integral part of the
contest. An official cannot be overly sensitive about criticism.

### 1.2.5 Fair and Impartial

A good official will be courteous with players and coaches during
the game. Conversations with the head coach before, during or after the game may give the
appearance of favoritism. If conditions warrant a conference, both head coaches should be
involved. Avoid physical contact with players and coaches. A player should be addressed by
number rather than by name. In addressing the captain or head coach of a team, do so by title.

### 1.2.6 Decisiveness

Quick and positive decisions are essential aspects of officiating.
Hesitation implies a lack of confidence. Self-confidence must be developed. Many decisions
can be questioned no matter how are ruled. The practice of making concise decisions must
be habitual. However, officials should not be hasty when there is a question at the table
regarding scoring, timing, disqualification, fouls, the alternating-possession arrow, etc. Take
time to try and prevent any mistake or error from being made.

### 1.2.7 Teamwork

Each official must give full cooperation to the crew and all personnel
associated with the game. Officials must be willing to share the responsibility and execute
their duties in a coordinated manner. Do not negatively or publicly comment about a game
officiated by another official.

### 1.2.8 Prevention

An official must anticipate potential trouble. The presence of an official
in whom the players have confidence will prevent most of these situations. Being in a position
to observe any unnecessary contact will go a long way toward preventing such contact.
Unsporting action is a circumstance that requires immediate attention before it gets out of
hand. Communicate expectations and penalize if needed. Officials must not tolerate rough
play or unsporting action. Decisiveness in ruling fouls when rough play begins will avoid later
loss of control which often results when warnings are used as a substitute for penalties.

### 1.2.9 Integrity

Honor game assignments. Avoid conflict of interest situations whenever
possible. Any situation that could potentially compromise the professional and/or personal
accountability of the official should be a guide in determining potential conflict of interest.
If an official accepts a game, that official should be there on time. If there is some good
reason for cancellation, the official should inform the appropriate supervisor immediately.

### 1.2.10 Decision-Making

A quality official will be quick to rule violations and/or fouls
when they occur. Do this consistently without regard to the score, position on the floor, whom
it may affect within the game, the school or head coach. Regardless of pressure from fans,
coaches or players, officials must have the professionalism to rule fouls and violations as
they occur. Your honesty must be above reproach. It takes real commitment to resist pressure
and intimidation. To a large extent, the personal reputation of an official will be based on
performance.

## 1.3 Game Awareness

### 1.3.1 General Provisions

A. Awareness of all game activity is important to afford officials the best opportunity to
make correct rulings.
B. Game awareness includes various aspects of judgment in making foul and violation
rulings, and as importantly, handling dead-ball situations – players, coaches and bench
personnel.
C. Creating an appropriate and professional relationship with players and coaches will
facilitate officiating the game.
D. Understand the appropriate boundaries of relationships to ensure that officials are not
and do not appear to be overly friendly with the players or coaches.
E. Approach the role as an official with professionalism at all times.
F. As a general principle, acknowledge head coaches and answer their questions at
appropriate times – do not respond to statements.
G. If an unusual situation warrants a conference, both head coaches should be involved
in the discussion. Both coaches should also be present for any discussion involving a fight,
correctable errors or mistakes in timing, scoring or alternating possession.

### 1.3.2 Game Clock (and Shot Clock, if applicable)

A. Be aware of the game clock when possible.
B. Work to look at the clock on any whistle to ensure that the clock is properly stopped.
C. Similarly, when the ball is put back in play, the official, signaling to start the clock,
should ensure that the clock is properly started.
D. Clock malfunctions occur; there are no provisions in the rules for “do-overs.” Know the
rules regarding these unusual situations and apply them appropriately.
E. Remember, an official’s count (backcourt, closely guarded, throw-in, etc.) can be used to
correct a timing mistake. Correction requires definite information.

### 1.3.3 Fights

A. Game awareness and making correct accurate rulings are the best ways to avoid fights
and player confrontations.
B. Be aware of matchups and rivalries both in individual games and during an overall season.
C. Should a fight occur, officials should use their voices and their whistles to gain the
attention of players.
D. Do not touch, hold or grab players – both for the safety of the crew and for liability
concerns.
E. One official should remain away from the action and observe non-participating players
and bench personnel.
F. At the earliest point, get teams to their benches. Officials should then confer to
determine appropriate penalties, if and how any free throws will be awarded and how play
will be resumed.

## 1.4 Uniform And Equipment

### 1.4.1 Official’s Uniform

The uniform shall be clean and neat. State association patches
or emblems shall be worn as specified. The standard uniform (unless modified by the state
association) consists of the following:

A. Belt: If worn, it shall be black.
B. Jacket: Black, if worn. Recommended for wear prior to game.
C. Shirt: Standard black/white vertically striped:
Short sleeves – approximately 8 inches in length; with black cuffs
“V” neck shirt shall be worn and an undershirt should not be visible

taped and may be visible. Wedding rings are permitted.
1.5 OFFICIALS’ PREGAME PROTOCOL

### 1.5.1 Arrival on Site

Officials should report to the proper athletic administrator at least
one hour before game time.

### 1.5.2 Officials’ Pregame Conference

A pregame conference is mandatory. The meeting
affords an opportunity for the crew to develop confidence in each other and goes a long way
in ensuring a smooth running game. The referee is responsible for conducting the meeting
in a private and secure location. The umpire(s) should participate and contribute to the
meeting. A sample of an officials’ pregame conference can be found at the back of the book.

### 1.5.3 Duties of the Referee

• Confer with scorer and timer before game time regarding their responsibilities.
• Recommend they be seated next to each other if they are not.
• Authorize the scorer to note and prevent any attempted illegal substitution.
• Designate the official timepiece and its operator, the official scorebook and official
scorer.
• Check game clock and other timing apparatus.
• Check device to indicate substitutions and end of a quarter/period.
• Inspect ball, baskets, boundaries, placement of crowd and extraneous apparatus to see
if special ground rules are necessary. Be sure the basket net is loose enough to permit the
ball to go through.
• Crew of Three: Obtain from the umpires the number of team members warming up for
each team and that starters are designated in the scorebook for each team.
• Crew of Two: Count the number of visiting team squad members. Check the visiting
team uniforms and numbers and other apparel for legality, including undershirts and
undergarments that extend below the pants. Check for jewelry, illegal casts or braces or any
other illegal equipment. Check for illegal headwear or secure authorization from the coach,
if the state association has approved. Players must be legally attired during the warm-up
period.

• Conduct the coach/captain conferences at the designated time(s). Verify with the head
coach that team members are legally and properly equipped and that all participants are
expected to exhibit proper sporting behavior.
• Ensure the official scorer is wearing a black-and-white vertically striped garment.
• Verify the coaching box and X in front of the scorer are properly marked.

### 1.5.4 Duties of the Umpire(s)

(Crew of Three: U1 is responsible for the following duties with the home team and U2 for
the visiting team)
• Count the number of home team squad members.
• Check the home team uniforms and numbers and other apparel for legality, including
undershirts and undergarments that extend below the pants.
• Report to the Referee if any home team squad member is wearing jewelry, illegal casts
or braces, or any other illegal equipment.
• Report to the Referee if any home team squad member is wearing illegal headwear
or secure authorization from the coach, if state association has approved. Players must be
legally attired during the warm-up period.

### 1.5.5 Sample Pregame Schedule

A. 15:00 – Officials enter court and go directly to positions.
B. 12:00 – Referee goes to the table and checks scorebook(s), briefs scorer and timer,
checks game ball.
C. 10:00 – Remaining official(s) go across the floor to join referee, greet the visiting
coach, then greet the home head coach.
• Referee goes to area in front of scorer’s table.
• U1 (and U2, if applicable) will get respective head coaches and captains from teams.
• Referee does introductions of officials, coaches and captain(s).
• Referee conducts pregame briefing to include discussing legal equipment and good
sporting behavior with head coaches and captain(s). Also discuss: team color, proper
basket, other appropriate items and answer any questions.
• Return to original positions.
• If teams return to dressing room, leave court, remove jackets, return to original position
when teams come out, stand at attention for National Anthem.

## 1.6 Duties Of Alternate Official

1.6.1: When an alternate official is used, assigned duties shall include, but are not limited
to the following:
A. Be present for pregame conference. Wear game uniform and jacket and be prepared
mentally and physically to officiate in case of an injury, illness or other emergencies.
B. Be seated at the scorer’s table as close to the scorer and timer as possible. Serve as
an aid to both the scorer and timer.
C. Keep a written record of all fouls ruled, the number of the player fouling, the number of
the free-throw shooter, the number of free throws and the time that the foul occurred.
D. Serve as an aid to game officials in case there is a scoring or timing error, a
substitution error, a correctable error, etc.
E. Your role is as a “working observer.” Use a data sheet to make appropriate notes and
monitor any irregularities in order to report to the referee - do not make any rulings.

* = Only applies to crew of three
BACKSIDE: Refers to the area in the free-throw lane when a player moves away from
the Lead into the lane.
BALANCE THE FLOOR: Refers to the positions of both the Lead and the Trail. When the
floor is balanced, the officials are near their respective sidelines. That is the normal
set position in two-person mechanics. The floor becomes un- balanced when the Lead
moves ball side.
BALL SIDE: The location of the ball in the normal frontcourt offensive alignment of a
team. In dividing the court down the middle, (using the basket as a Center point), end
line to end line. The side of the court where the ball is located is ball side.
BALL SIDE MECHANIC: Refers to the Lead moving across the free throw lane to the
ball side of the court, on the Trail’s side, resulting in both officials being on the same
side of the court. The Lead moves ball side when the majority of players and the ball
goes below the free-throw line extended on the Trail’s side of the court. This movement
will allow the Lead to get a clear view of post play and eliminate being “straight-lined.”
Primary Coverage Areas (PCA) are adjusted when this occurs.
BALL WATCHING: The unfavorable condition that has more officials’ eyes on the on-
ball competitive matchup than are necessary, to the neglect of important off-ball action
and activity. Any more than two eyes on the on-ball matchup are typically too many.
Rare exceptions to this principle exist when a “two-referee play” occurs.
BOXING-IN PRINCIPLE: Refers to both officials, on opposite sides of the court, having
all players between them, and having both sidelines and end lines covered.
BUMP AND RUN: A technique when one official “bumps” the other official out of that
official’s current position and the vacating official “moves” down the court into a new
position.

# Part 2: Terminology

*CENTER OFFICIAL: The outside official, who is in the off-ball position, midway
between a step below the free-throw line extended and the top of the circle. The Center
official may be tableside or opposite side.
CLOSE DOWN: Movement of an official (a step or two) related to movement of the ball
to improve angles. On a try for goal shot attempt, the Trail and Center (3-person) closes
down toward the end line. The Lead closes down toward the nearest lane line extended
to anticipate a rotation based on the position of the ball on the perimeter.
CLOSED LOOK: The less-than-favorable angle an official has on a competitive matchup
due to being straight-lined or stacked, rendering him unable to officiate the actions of
the defensive player in an unobstructed fashion. An open look, which provides a view
of the space between opponents, is prefered and attainable by a “position adjust” a
step or two to the left or to the right. A closed look hinders the ability to identify if/when
illegal activity occurs by one of the players in the competitive matchup.
COMPETITIVE MATCH-UP: Opponents who are working/competing against each other
as opposed to two opponents who are more than six feet apart.
DEAD-BALL OFFICIATING: Activity during the time immediately after the ball becomes
dead. Don’t stop officiating when the ball is dead. Continue to monitor the players and
bench personnel.
DOUBLE WHISTLE: A situation in which two or more officials blow their whistles on a
foul or violation.
FREE-THROW LINE EXTENDED: An imaginary line drawn from the free-throw line out
to the sidelines. The area around the free-throw line extended is a significant guideline
for 2-person officiating coverage and movements.
FREE-THROW LANE LINE: Refers to the free-throw lane lines perpendicular to the end
line which intersect the free-throw line and the end line and run parallel to the sideline.
During free throws, players are lined up in free-throw lane line spaces along the lane
line.
LEAD MOVING TO TRAIL: Refers to the movements and changed positions of the Lead
during a transition play. For example, when a play moves from one end of the court to
the other, the Lead moves from that position to the Trail position at the other end of the
court.
LEAD OFFICIAL: The official positioned along and off the end line. The Lead official
may be tableside or opposite table; will usually be on the opposite side of the court as
the Trail (Crew of 2) or will be on the same side of the court as the Trail (Crew of 3).
LOW BLOCK: The area along the free-throw lane line closest to the basket but not in
the lane.

MOVE TO IMPROVE: A technique that means to “move your feet” in order to “improve
your angle” on the play. Helps to eliminate being “straight-lined.”
OFFICIATING THE ARC: A technique that provides the Trail official with better court
coverage. Trail will move in a motion that parallels the three-point line in an attempt to
be in closer proximity to the ball and also provides for better coverage of the three-
point shot.
OPPOSITE SIDE: Away from the table.
PERIMETER AREA: The perimeter area is the area in a half-court setting away from the
basket nearer the three-point line.
“PINCH THE PAINT”: Close down at the lane line in the close-down position. As the
drive begins to move through the middle of the lane or from an angle on the weak side
of the basket, the official should take a step or two into the imaginary extended free-
throw lane to maintain an open angle for such a drive.
POINT OF INTERRUPTION (POI): Method of resuming play due to an official’s
inadvertent whistle, an interrupted game, a correctable error, a double personal or
simultaneous personal foul. Play is resumed by a free throw or throw-in where the ball
was located when the stoppage occurred.
POST AREA: The post area is around the low free-throw lane and in the bottom half of
the lane nearest the basket.
PREVENTIVE OFFICIATING: Refers to actions by officials who prevent problems from
occurring by talking to players and coaches. Preventive officiating is often related to
dead-ball officiating.
PRIMARY COVERAGE AREA (PCA): Area of responsibility for each official. PCA is
determined by ball location.
PRIMARY DEFENDER: Player who has initially guarded one’s opponent.
R, U1, U2: Abbreviations for Referee, Umpire 1 and Umpire 2. All three have specific
responsibilities during the pre-game listed in the rules book and officials manual.
*ROTATION: A live-ball situation, whereby the location of the ball keys a change
in coverage for the officials. In 3-person mechanics, this is implemented when the
Lead official moves to ball side dictating a change of position by the Center and Trail
officials. The Lead should not rotate until all three officials are in the frontcourt.
SCREEN: A legal action by a player who delays or prevents an opponent from reaching
a desired position.

SECONDARY DEFENDER: A secondary defender is a teammate who has helped a
primary defender who has been beaten by an opponent because they failed to establish
or maintain a guarding position.
SELLING THE CALL: Placing emphasis on a ruling with louder voice and whistle, and
slightly more demonstrative signals. Selling only occurs on close calls and should be
used sparingly. It is designed to help the ruling gain acceptance and show the official’s
decisiveness. Officials should avoid the appearance of showboating.
SKIP PASS: A pass thrown across the perimeter from one side of the court to the other.
SPACING: Distance between the official and the play. If an official is too close or too
far, the official cannot see the play clearly.
STAY DEEP: Refers to an official’s position on the court away from the play, usually the
Trail in a half-court setting. When the Trail stays deep, the Trail stays out of the passing
lanes and avoids interfering with the play.
STRAIGHT-LINE: Refers to a situation that occurs when an official allows the vision to
be obstructed by a player or players; having to look through a player’s body instead of
in between players. When a straight-line occurs, the official is not able to accurately
see playing action. The situation is also known as getting “stacked.”
*STRONG SIDE: Side of the court determined by the location of Lead official.
SWITCH: A dead-ball situation created by an official who rules a violation or foul. After
a violation is ruled or a foul is reported to the table, there may be a change in position
of the officials. The switch will normally involve the ruling official moving to a new
position on the court.
TABLESIDE: The side of the court where the scorer’s and timer’s table is located.
TOP OF THE KEY: The top of the key is the area near the top of the free-throw circle.
TRAIL OFFICIAL: The outside official positioned nearest the division line, approximately
28 feet from the end line (near the top of the three-point line). The Trail official may be
tableside or opposite side; will usually be on the opposite side of the court as the Lead
in two-person mechanics. In three-person mechanics, the Trail is on the same side as
the Lead official, positioned at approximately 28 feet from the end line.
TRAIL MOVING TO LEAD: Refers to the movements of the former Trail official during
a transition to the other end of the court. For example, when play moves from one end
of the court to the other, the Trail moves from that position to the Lead position at the
other end.

WALK DOWN: The action of an official covering a competitive matchup in his PCA
during a drive to the basket. As the play goes away from the official, he must typically
react by taking a step or two toward the basket, in effect, walking the play down as it
goes to the basket. This keeps the covering official connected to and engaged with the
play at hand rather than bailing early to the other end, abandoning action to the Lead.
*WEAK SIDE: The side of the court opposite the Lead official; the Center’s side of the
court.
*WIDE TRIANGLE: All three officials, when in the correct position, form the geometric
shape of a wide triangle; keeping all players and activity within the triangle.

# Part 4: Game Procedures for a Crew of Two Officials

The two-official system is designed to provide efficient and effective coverage by two
officials. This coverage is generally used at the sub-varsity level, although some states do
use two-person mechanics for varsity contests, and allows two officials to manage the
administrative and adjudicating responsibilities required of game officials. The crew of two
requires officials to be in proper positioning to see on-ball and off-ball action within their
primary coverage areas as well as assist in secondary coverage areas.
Positioning is key. It is essential for officials to move quickly and efficiently within the
Lead and Trail positions while maintaining proper sight lines to observe play within each
PCA. In addition to proper positioning within each position, it is essential for smooth,
seamless transitions from Lead to Trail and Trail to Lead. Dividing the playing court into two
PCAs creates a challenge for crews of two.
Clear verbal and non-verbal communication during pre-game meetings and throughout
the contest is a necessity for an effective two-person crew. Setting the expectations
during the pre-game meeting allows crews to establish a baseline of understanding for a
smooth game. When situations arise that require non-verbal or verbal communication, it is
essential for crews of two to make frequent eye contact and communicate verbally when
appropriate, so as to not interrupt the flow of the game.
While the two-official system is not as efficient as utilizing a crew of three, it can
be effective when officials are diligent in maintaining proper positioning and open
communication.

Both officials shall arrive on the court at least 15 minutes prior to game time and be
positioned on the side of the court opposite the scorer’s table. Each official should be
approximately 28 feet from the nearest end line.
During that time, both officials observe team warmups and monitor the court for any
illegal activity (dunking, etc.). The R observes the visiting team while U observes the home
team. Both officials perform duties as prescribed in 1.5.
Optionally, after the R returns from the scorer’s table, the R and U can switch positions in
order to observe both teams.

At the conclusion of play for the first half, the officials are now positioned halfway
between the farthest point of the center circle and the sideline opposite the scorer’s table
(#1 in MechaniGram). After both teams have left their benches and gone to their respective
locker rooms, both officials walk over to the scorer’s table and the R takes care of specified
duties (#2 in MechaniGram). After the R confirms the possession arrow is pointed in the
proper direction to begin play in the third quarter, the officials leave together for their locker
room (#3 in MechaniGram).
The officials should ensure both teams are notified three minutes prior to the start of the
second half. During the halftime intermission, the officials shall return to the court for the
second half, the officials will stand across the court until the one-minute mark. At that time,
the U will secure the ball and bounce it to the R. The R will take a position with the ball at
the division line on the sideline opposite the table indicating the direction of play with the
placement of the ball. The U shall take a position on the division line on the opposite edge of
the restraining circle until the first horn sounds.

During the intermission between quarters and any extra periods, the R stands with the
ball at the division line on the sideline opposite the table. The ball shall be placed on the
side of the official that indicates the direction of play.
The U shall take a position on the division line on the opposite side edge of the
restraining circle. The U is responsible for acknowledging substitutes and making sure that
they report prior to the warning signal.
There should be no visiting with coaches or players unless it is to confer about a game
situation. The officials are then responsible to count the players when the teams return to
the court to begin play. Use preventive officiating to make sure there are five players on the
court per team.
The throw-in to start the second, third and fourth quarters shall be administered by the R
at the division line opposite the table. The R indicates jersey color and direction, designates
the throw-in spot, sounds the whistle to alert players that play is about to begin and places
the ball at the thrower’s disposal.

SCORER & TIMER

CREW OF TWO
TIME-OUTS PROVISIONS:
1. If a player or head coach requests a time-out while the ball is live, ignore the request if
the ball is in control of an opponent or not in control of either team.
2. If the request is during a dead ball or during a live ball that is in control of the requesting
player or a teammate, it shall be granted.
3. No time-out may be granted during an interrupted dribble.
4. The opponents may not be granted a time-out once the ball is at the disposal of the
thrower for a throw-in or the ball is at the free-thrower’s disposal.
5. Do not grant a time-out after a foul until the necessary information has been reported to
the scorer.
6. Do not grant a time-out until an injured or disqualified player directed to leave the game
has been replaced.
7. After the free thrower has the ball or the ball is at the disposal of the thrower on a throw-
in, the thrower or a teammate may request and be granted a time-out, but the opponent
may not.
8. After a successful free throw or field goal, any player or head coach may request a time-
out, until the non-scoring team secures the ball for the throw-in. Once the official begins
the 5-second count, the scoring team cannot be granted a time-out.
9. If an official erroneously grants a time-out request, it is not a team infraction. The time-
out will be granted and charged but there is no other penalty assessed.
10. A request for an excess time-out shall be granted, but it is penalized with a team
technical foul.
11. If opponents simultaneously request a time-out during a dead ball, charge a time-out to
each team (or better, hear or see one request before the other).
12. The official may suspend play to permit a player to correct or replace displaced
eyeglasses or contact lens without charging a time-out.
REPORTING PROCEDURES:
1. Sound the whistle while giving the stop the clock signal.
2. While moving to the reporting area, look for verification from the head coach as to what
type of time-out is to be charged. Communicate the type of time-out using the proper
signal. A 60-second timeout is the default when none is declared by the head coach.
3. A non-ruling official should ensure that the non-timeout-calling team is aware of the type
of time-out being granted.
4. Within the reporting area, then signal the type of time-out being granted, Signal 11 for
a 60-second time-out and Signal 12 for a 30-second time-out. Verbally state the team
color, verbally and visually give the player number or head coach (indicate by forming the
shape of a “C” with the hand) making the request. Allow players reasonable time to get
to their time-out areas, then point to the timer and verbally instruct the timer to begin the
time-out period.
5. Notify a coach when that team has used its allotted time-outs.
INJURY/BLOOD:
1. If a player is injured, an officials’ time-out shall be declared when necessary. When
appropriate, bench personnel should be beckoned at the first opportunity. If bench
personnel enters the court (beckoned or not), the injured player must leave the game

until the next opportunity to re-enter by rule (game clock properly starts) unless a time-
out is requested and granted by that player’s team.
2. Officials should never touch an injured player.
3. Any player who exhibits signs, symptoms or behaviors consistent with a concussion
(such as loss of consciousness, headache, dizziness, confusion or balance problems)
shall be immediately removed from the game by the officials and shall not return to play
until cleared by an appropriate health care professional.
4. If a player is apparently bleeding, has an open wound, an excessive amount of blood on
the uniform or has blood on their person (if not resolved within the allowed 20 seconds),
that player shall be directed to leave the game and may not re-enter until the bleeding/
blood has been taken care of. The same re-entry procedures as above apply. NOTE: The
head coach may take a timeout to address the issue or substitute for the player.

CREW OF TWO
During a 60-second time-out, the official adminstering the ensuing throw-in must take
the ball to where it will next be made live and hold the ball next to their body to indicate the
direction of the ensuing throw-in. The location of the official will cue the teams where the
ball will be made live next. If play is to be resumed with the free throw, the administering
official will hold the ball on the free throw line.
The non-administering official is positioned at the division line opposite the table outside
the center circle. The administering official is positioned at the throw-in spot.  If the time-
out is during the closing minutes of the game, the referee must confirm personally with the
scorer that the score is correct and that the scorebook agrees with the scoreboard in all
aspects. Officials must be alert to beckon properly-reported substitutes into the game.
At the first horn (15 seconds remaining), the non-administering official will step toward
the nearest team huddle and notify that team by raising an index finger and saying “first
horn,” before moving to the other team horn to repeat the process.
NOTE: If persmissible oncourt cheering activities make it necessary, officials may move
to a safe and convenient alternative location on or off the court.

4.2 Jump Ball
After the National Anthem and the introductions of the players, the players are usually
getting last words of instruction before going out onto the court. At that time, the officials
should leave their positions at the scorer’s table and go to specific locations on the court.
The R (or the official designated to throw the jump ball) takes the ball and moves to a spot
near the far sideline, facing the scorer’s table.
The U shall take a position on the tableside sideline, at the division line, facing the R.
Note: The R can toss the jump ball or designate the U. Within this manual, the official
tossing the ball will always be referred to as the R. Even though the R may designate a
tosser, the R will handle all ensuing throw-ins to start the remaining periods.
SCORER & TIMER
AFTER INTRODUCTIONS, BEFORE JUMP BALL

The U (or non-tosser) is positioned near the intersection of the sideline and the division
line facing the R directly in front of the table. Before entering the Center restraining circle,
the R makes eye contact with the U, who signals to the R that table personnel and the U are
ready to go. Both officials make sure the teams are facing the correct direction, count the
number of players of both teams and ensure the game clock is properly set.
While still outside the circle, the R notifies both team captains that play is about to begin.
The R then verbally states the jersey color of each team and indicates the direction of its
goal for the first half. The R blows the whistle with a sharp blast before entering the circle,
then removes the whistle from the mouth prior to tossing the ball.
Before the toss, the U uses the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2). The R tosses the ball high
enough so the jumpers tap the ball on its downward flight. The U starts the clock when
the ball is legally touched. If the toss is poor, either official should immediately sound the
whistle, signal the game clock should not start and re-administer the jump ball.
The U must maintain a wide field of vision while the R administers the toss. The U is
primarily responsible for the position and action of the eight non-jumpers. The R is primarily
responsible for the position and action of the two jumpers.

the R has cleared the players and begun to move into position.
The R will hold momentarily to allow players to clear and then will move to the Trail
enabling coverage of the sideline opposite the Lead.
After the ball is possessed, the Trail should glance at the alternating-possession arrow
to make sure it is pointing in the right direction. If incorrect, the crew will wait for the first
dead ball and correct it.
Note: If possession is gained in the backcourt, the U may need to move with the ball to

4.3 Court Coverage
In the frontcourt, PCAs shift depending on which official is on-ball. In general, the officials
will work to keep all players “boxed in.”
In the MechaniGram, the Lead’s on-ball responsibilities include the area below the free-
throw line extended to the far edge of the free-throw lane line (away from the Lead) when
the Lead is opposite the Trail. If the Lead is ball side, the Lead’s area of responsibility grows.
It includes the area below the free-throw line extended to the three-point line.
When the Lead is on-ball, the Trail’s off-ball responsibilities include the area above the
free-throw line extended to the division line and the lane area from the free-throw lane line
(nearest the Trail) to the sideline nearest the Trail. The Trail’s off-ball area of responsibility
decreases when the Lead is on-ball, ball side. It is the area above the free-throw line
extended and outside the three-point line.
Five-Second Closely-Guarded Count: Officials are responsible for a silent and visible
five-second closely-guarded (within 6 feet) count (Signal 9) within their PCA. During this
count, if the ball moves out of an official’s PCA, that official shall maintain the count until the
count is appropriately ended. Anytime a count restarts (going directly from a holding to a
dribbling count or a dribbling to a holding count), the official shall switch hands/arms.

BASIC FRONTCOURT COVERAGE

44    NFHS Basketball Offi cials Manual 2025-26
Covering boundary lines is among the most diffi cult tasks using a crew of two offi cials. In
emphasizing off-ball coverage for the Lead, it can become diffi cult for the Lead to offi ciate
the Lead’s sideline.
The Lead is primarily responsible for the nearer frontcourt end line and and nearer
sideline as shown above. The Trail is primarily responsible for the nearer sideline and is
responsible for ruling on all possible backcourt violations at the division line. In addition, in
the event of a quick transition, the Trail is also responsible for the end line at the other end.
If the ball goes out of bounds and the covering offi cial needs help, that offi cial should fi rst
stop the clock (Signal 2) and look in the direction of the other offi cial and verbalize “help.”
If the non-ruling offi cial has defi nite knowledge, that offi cial will verbally and visually signal
the appropriate ruling (no conference between offi cials). The primary offi cial will then mirror
this information.
If the non-ruling offi cial has defi nite information regarding an out-of-bounds ruling that
has been made by a partner, the non-ruling offi cial goes to the ruling offi cial and provides
the additional information. If the ruling offi cial makes the decision to change the ruling, the
ruling offi cial is the one to sound the whistle and signal the change.
One particular item of note is when the ball goes out of bounds above the free-throw line
extended on the Lead’s sideline. While the Lead has primary responsibility of this area, the
Trail must be aware of the situation and be ready to provide assistance, if needed. Offi cials
should pregame the situations in which a non-responsible offi cial should approach the
ruling offi cial.

In the frontcourt, the Trail is responsible for the majority of the three-point line. The Trail’s
coverage of a three-point try extends to the free-throw line extended opposite of the Trail’s
current position. The Lead is responsible for any attempt below the free-throw line extended
on the Lead’s PCA of the court.
On three-point attempts, only the covering offi cial should indicate the attempt (Signal
18). The indication should be made with the arm closest to the center of the court so the
table personnel can see it better. The covering offi cial should also signal if the attempt is
successful (Signal 18).
If the Trail signals a successful three-point attempt, the Lead shall not mirror the
successful signal. If the Lead signals an attempt, which is successful, the Trail mirrors the
successful signal. There is no need to mirror an attempt signal. This is imperative since
the covering offi cial signaling the attempt is also primarily responsible for monitoring the
airborne shooting player’s return to the fl oor.
The Lead should be ready to assist the Trail on a three-point attempt in transition.

THREE-POINT RESPONSIBILITIES

46    NFHS Basketball Offi cials Manual 2025-26

While coverage areas for all offi cials are well-defi ned, there can be areas on the court
that occasionally are watched by more than one offi cial — typically where PCAs intersect.
Generally, the offi cial who has primary coverage at the time of the whistles should make
the ruling.
If the secondary offi cial has a ruling that occurred before the primary offi cial’s ruling or
has information that should be discussed with the primary offi cial, the secondary offi cial
should close into the play quickly toward the primary offi cial.
Only if necessary should the offi cials come together to discuss the play. Generally, the
decision on the fi nal ruling should be left to the primary area offi cial.
Keys to managing double-whistles:
1. Give the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2) and refrain from giving an immediate
preliminary signal.
2. Make good eye contact with each other.
3. Understand where the play originated.
4. Understand each position’s PCA.

HANDLING DOUBLE WHISTLES

CREW OF TWO
Drives to the basket when the ball handler passes the ball to a teammate then crashes
into a defender below the free throw line are known as “pass and crash” situations.
In general, when a player is driving to the basket with the ball from an official’s PCA, that
official has primarily responsibility for that player and the ball all the way to the basket –
even if the drive moves into the other official’s primary area.
In addition, on drives to the basket initiated on the Trail side of the court, if the ball
handler makes a pass, the Trail stays with the “crash” and Lead takes the “pass.”
The official with primary responsibility of the play must be given the opportunity to make
an initial ruling first. This does not preclude the non-covering official from make a ruling, but
a delayed response is warranted.

PASS/CRASH IN LANE

Rebounding coverages are divided and fall into primary and secondary coverage areas.
If a try is attempted in the Trail’s PCA, the Trail is primarily responsible for following the
airborne shooter’s return to the floor. After clearing the shooter’s return, the Trail is primarily
responsible for basket interference/goaltending and perimeter rebound coverage.
The Lead is primarily responsible for all other rebounding action. Both officials maintain
secondary responsibility for rebound outside of their primary responsibility and should be
prepared to rule as such.

The delay offense, sometimes referred to as the “spread” or “four-corner” offense
requires officials to change their basic positions. The delay offense spreads players out to
all corners of the frontcourt and is designed to run the clock down while avoiding double
teams.
The Trail must be behind the offense. The Lead must move around the corner to monitor
lateral movement. The Lead can move across the corner to monitor the action near the
basket.
OFFICIATING THE DELAY OFFENSE
SCORER & TIMER

With less than one minute remaining on the game clock in each quarter/period, both
officials should communicate this by raising one arm straight above the head and extending
one finger in the air.
Regardless of the end of the court, the Trail official is responsible for making the ruling
on any last-second shot and should communicate this to the Lead by signaling with a hand-
on-chest signal when the game clock is near 15 seconds. This signal should be repeated
when the responsibility changes between officials on any change of possession. The official
should not sound the whistle at the end of a quarter/period unless the try is not released
before the sounding of the horn or a violation preceded the release of the try.
When there is a throw-in from the backcourt a long pass is expected, the Lead should
be prepared to assist, especially if the shot attempt is near the three-point line. If the Lead
(non-ruling official) has information regarding the allowing or disallowing of a goal, the Lead
should go directly to the Trail (ruling official) for a brief discussion. Ultimately, the R will
make the final decision in case of disagreement, or in rare instances, the table officials may
be consulted in the event the horn did not sound or could not be heard.
When play is resumed with a throw-in or free throw and three-tenths of a second or less
remains on the game clock, no field goal may be scored by a try for goal. Only a tap may
score. This does not apply if the game clock does not display tenths of a second.

SCORER & TIMER
GENERAL POSITIONING
The Lead’s base position is approximately four feet off the end line. Officials may need to
adjust their depth as the Lead based on their own comfort level.
In general, the Lead should always remain off the end line and should not be wider than
the three-point line and will move along the end line based on the movement and location
of players.
As the ball crosses to the Trail’s side of the court, the Lead should close down to be
located just outside the lane line extended.

The use of ball-side mechanics are dependent upon the location of players and the ball.
When the majority of players and the ball are on the Trail’s side, below the free-throw line
extended, the Lead should close-down toward the near lane line.
Moving across the lane is a similar rotation used in a crew of three. If the Lead reads a
possible play below the free-throw line extended on the Trail’s side of the court (quick try
or drive excluded), this dictates the need for the Lead to rotate over. Movement by the Lead
across the lane should be brisk and with purpose. Even when moving across the lane, the
Lead must continue to officiate players in the post. The Lead should work to not be caught
under the basket as play moves there.
This temporary rotation is to assist the Trail in covering the bottom of the Trail’s PCA.
When action moves outside of this area or if a turnover occurs, the Lead should return
across the lane.

BALL-SIDE MECHANICS

## 4.4 The Lead Position

CREW OF TWO
When the Lead is ball side watching action in the post and a goal is scored, there is no
need to rush back to the lane line opposite the Trail and balance the floor. If the Lead can
immediately balance the floor after the successful goal without interfering with the ensuing
throw-in, the Lead should do so. However, in most situations, there is not enough time to
balance the floor without interfering and missing action.
The Lead should watch for players interfering with the ball after the successful goal. The
Lead watches the player collect the ball and move out-of-bounds for the throw-in. Finally,
the Lead watches the thrower, the throw-in and action on the court. It is acceptable to do
this from the Trail side of the court before transitioning back to the far sideline.
In MechaniGram A, the Lead is ball side watching the post players when Team A makes
a jump shot. Team B grabs the ball and moves out-of-bounds for a throw-in. The Lead does
not have enough time to balance the floor before the throw-in. In MechaniGram B, Team B
is out-of-bounds and throws a quick inbounds pass. The “old” Lead/new Trail, still on the
opposite side, watches the thrower and throw-in, then quickly swings behind the thrower to
balance the floor.

When the ball drops below the free-throw line extended on the Lead’s side of the court,
the Lead has two responsibilities: Watch the post players on the near low block and watch
the perimeter player with the ball. The Trail extends their Secondary Coverage Area to help
Lead with players in the post.
To best cover this area, the Lead should back off the end line and move toward the
sideline. The Lead’s shoulders should not be parallel to the end line and angle them slightly;
that movement increases the Lead’s field of vision and gives the Lead a chance to see both
areas.
Primary coverage is on-ball; secondary coverage is off-ball. With that improved position,
the Lead has a chance to see both in this field of view.

GENERAL POSITIONING
The Trail’s home position is at or above the top of the semi-circle (three-point line) and
along, or just inside, the sideline.
The Trail should be prepared to “officiate the arc” to obtain better angles on play, but
must be mindful of passing lanes. The Trail may move down toward the end line to obtain a
better angle, as needed.

With a crew of two officials, the Trail official often has to get off the sideline and move
toward the center of the court to officiate action on the far side of the floor. When that
happens, the Trail can get caught in the middle on a swing pass from one side of the court
to the other. Adjustments must be made.
When a swing pass moves from the sideline opposite the Trail across the top of the semi-
circle (three-point line) to the near-side wing, the Trail can get straightlined because of the
position off the sideline.
By using a “move to improve” approach, a simple one- or two-step adjustment toward
the Center of the court gives the Trail the proper angle. The Trail must fight the urge to run
around the entire play toward the sideline, using countless and inefficient steps.

CREW OF TWO
Effective court coverage requires significant movement by the Trail.
When an offensive player has the ball on the side of the floor opposite the Trail, the Trail
must move away from the near sideline and get proper angles. By staying too close to the
near sideline, the Trail cannot effectively see action near the ball and must make judgments
from a distance — way too far away to convince anyone the Trail saw the play correctly.
In the MechaniGram, the player with the ball is far away from the Trail official — though
the player is still the Trail’s responsibility — and there is defensive pressure. To see the play
well, the Trail must move off the near sideline and work to get a good angle.
Avoid moving straight toward the play: Officials could interfere with the play by stepping
into a passing lane. Take an angle toward the division line to decrease the chances of
interfering with the play. In extreme cases, officials may even position themselves in the
backcourt.
By moving off the sideline and angling toward the backcourt, officials are in a much
better position to see the play.
SCORER & TIMER
MOVEMENT OFF SIDELINE

The Trail has more responsibilities than simply watching the shooter. Too often, a shot
goes up and the Trail’s first thought is to start moving to the other end of the floor to avoid
getting beat down court. When the Trail leaves, the Lead is left with offensive players
crashing the boards and defensive players doing all they can to grab the rebound.
The Trail must help with rebounding action. When a player takes a jump shot within the
Trail’s coverage area, the first responsibility is to watch the airborne shooter all the way
back to the floor to ensure there are no offensive or defensive fouls. While watching that
action, the Trail should be moving a couple of steps toward the end line.
Once everything is okay with the shooter and surrounding action, the steps toward the
end line allow the Trail to help the Lead by watching rebounding action. A step or two to
improve an official’s angle is all that is necessary to successfully watch rebounding action.
The Trail is likely to see an offensive player pushing (or crashing into) a defensive player
from behind — something that is difficult for the Lead to see from the end line. The Trail
should avoid going below the free-throw line extended.
Resist the urge to sprint to the other end of the floor when the shot goes up. Move
toward the end line to get rebounding angles.
SCORER & TIMER
SHOT
MOVEMENT ON JUMP SHOT

CREW OF TWO
In two-person mechanics, the Lead official should move to the ball side of the lane when
the player with the ball is below the free-throw line extended and a potential post pass is
evident.
Though ball-side mechanics are effective for controlling post play, one weakness is
coverage of a skip pass to the opposite wing player for a quick shot. A skip pass is a quick
pass from one side of the floor to the other, designed to take advantage of a sagging
defense.
Though the opposite wing player is primarily observed by the Lead official (even though
the Lead moved ball side), when a skip pass occurs the Trail should adjust a step or two
toward the wing player (to the center of the floor) and get a good angle to rule on three-
point attempts, fouls and possibly obvious out-of-bounds infractions. Though a long-
distance look, that is better than having the Lead guess because the Lead’s looking through
lane traffic or sprinting head-down to the other side of the court and missing the banging
going on in the post.
If there is no quick shot and the Lead can adjust back to the other side of the court
without haste, the Lead then picks up the ball (assuming it is below the free-throw line
extended) and the Trail moves back toward the sideline, getting good angles to watch
off-ball. The Lead must continue to watch off-ball in the lane area while moving until
completely across the lane and in a good position to pick up the player with the ball.
In the MechaniGram, the Lead has moved ball side when a skip pass is thrown and that
player immediately shoots. Since the Lead is ball side and does not have enough time to
balance the floor, the Trail picks up the shot, even though the attempt is below the free-
throw line extended. The Trail should close down toward the play to improve the angle.

TRAIL PICKS UP SHOOTER

A trouble spot for the Lead develops when a player with the ball on the low block spins
toward the middle of the lane away from the Lead. The quick spin move often leaves the
Lead straightlined and without a good look on the play.
Many times, a defender near the free-throw line will drop down into the lane and
challenge the move toward the basket. That is when an official will commonly see that
defender slap at the offensive player, trying to poke the ball away. That steal attempt is
sometimes a foul — one that goes unseen by the now-straightlined Lead.
The Trail must help out and watch the area in the lane when a post player spins away
from the Lead. Commonly referred to as the Lead’s “backside,” the Trail has a much better
look at the play after penetrating toward the end line for an improved angle.
In the MechaniGram, the post player has the ball on the low block in front of the Lead.
That player spins toward the middle of the lane and drives toward the basket. The defender
drops down and attempts the steal. The Lead watches the post-up action and the initial spin
move. The Trail should close down toward the end line, gets a good angle and watches the
perimeter defender on the play. The Lead’s backside is protected.
If the Trail sees a foul, the Trail should come in with a strong ruling. This is done by
moving toward the action to cut down the distance on the play.
SCORER & TIMER
TROUBLE SPOT
TRAIL WORKS BACKSIDE

CREW OF TWO
There are many benefits of the Lead moving ball side for post action. One potential
problem, however, is weak-side rebounding action. With the Lead on the same side of the
floor as the Trail, the lane area opposite both officials can present problems.
With the Lead ball side and already watching post play near the closest lane line, it
is difficult for the Lead to watch players away from that area in the lane. First, primary
concentration is — and should be — on the post play. Second, it is difficult for the Lead to
see the opposite side of the lane because the Lead is looking through lane congestion and
is easily straightlined.
When the Lead moves ball side, it is the Trail’s responsibility to observe weak-side
rebounding action. Though somewhat of a long-distance look, with the proper close
down toward the end line to get a good angle the Trail can effectively watch weak-side
rebounding action.
In the MechaniGram, the Trail watches the perimeter player deliver a drop pass to the
post player, who has effectively posted up on the low block. The Lead already moved ball
side anticipating the play. The post player seals off the defender and pivots strongly to the
basket. The Lead watches the post-up action.
Anticipating the play, the Trail adjusts for a good angle and looks opposite. From that
spot, the Trail can look through the lane and watch the players battle on the weakside for
rebounding positioning.
If the Trail sees a foul on the weakside, the Trail should come in with a strong ruling. This is
done by moving toward the action to cut down the distance on the play.

The bump-and-run is a mechanic used by two-person crews to move swiftly from the
frontcourt after a violation.
When an offensive violation occurs in the Trail’s coverage area, the Trail stops the clock,
signals the violation and the direction of play, then points to the designated spot for the
throw-in. Next – after checking that there are no problems – the Trail hustles down court
while viewing the action behind and become the new Lead.
After seeing the Trail’s signals, the Lead will move toward the designated spot for the
throw-in. The Lead becomes the new Trail. The Lead “bumps” the Trail down court and the
Trail moving to Lead “runs” the floor.
In the MechaniGram, Team A causes the ball to go out-of-bounds. The Trail correctly
stops the clock, signals a violation and the direction, then communicates the throw-in spot
to the Lead. The Trail then moves down court and becomes the new Lead.
The bump-and-run serves two main purposes: The Trail official has a better chance of
avoiding problems near the violation and the officials move into place quicker and get the
ball live faster.

THE MOVEMENT OFF SIDELINE
Effective two-person court coverage requires significant movement by the Trail off the
sideline. The same philosophies are true in the transition game when play is moving from
the backcourt to the frontcourt.
When an offensive player has the ball on the side of the floor opposite the Trail, the Trail
must move away from the near sideline and get proper angles. By staying too close to the
near sideline, the Trail cannot effectively see action near the ball and must make judgments
from a distance — way too far to convince anyone the Trail saw the play correctly.
In the MechaniGram, the offense dribbles the ball upcourt opposite the new Trail as
defensive pressure is applied. The rest of the players are advancing to the frontcourt as the
new Lead watches off-ball. To see the play well, the new Trail must move far off the near
sideline and work to get a good angle.
The new Trail should maintain distance and avoid moving straight toward the play as to
not interfere with the play by stepping into a passing lane.
By moving off the sideline and angling toward the play, the official is in a much better
position to see the play.

## 4.6 Transitions

LEAD HELPS IN BACKCOURT
In MechaniGram A, there are six players in the backcourt. The Lead is positioned near
the division line to help with backcourt players away from the Trail. The Lead must also
watch players in the frontcourt.

all of those players. The Lead moves into the frontcourt and watches all players there,

REBOUND
TROUBLE SPOT
The same pass/crash principles that apply in the lane area apply all over the court. One
trouble spot for offi cials is the pass/crash when a team in transition starts a break up the
court. Many times players will leave their feet to make a pass then crash into defenders.
In the MechaniGram, the rebounder throws an outlet pass to a streaking teammate. That
player catches the pass and dribbles up court trying to start a fastbreak.
The defender steps in to stop the offensive player from advancing into the frontcourt. As
the offensive player leaps into the air and passes to a teammate, a crash ensues.
The Lead must quickly read the fastbreak and move toward the sideline to become
the new Trail. The new Trail has a good look at the offensive player leaping, passing and
crashing.
The Trail who becomes the new Lead must also quickly read the fastbreak and move into
the frontcourt. The new Lead’s primary responsibility is the player catching the pass. In rare
circumstances, if the new Trail did not get out on the break fast enough to see the crash,
the new Lead’s secondary coverage area is the crash. That is more likely, however, when
the pass/crash occurs in the center of the court.

LEAD HELPS ON THREE-POINTER
The transition game is difficult to cover with a crew of two officials. It is especially tough
when quick outlet passes lead to quick shots at the other end of the court.
When quick, long passes advance the ball upcourt, the new Lead must be prepared to
help the Trail determine whether or not a shot is a three-point try. The help occurs even
though the shot attempt is in an area not normally covered by the Lead.
When there is a quick outlet pass that leads to another quick, long pass, the new Trail
usually does not have enough time to get into the frontcourt and get a good angle on a
shot. Because of the distance and poor angle between the Trail and the shot, the Trail is left
guessing. The new Lead must recognize the quick transition play and help the new Trail by
judging the shot.
In the MechaniGram, the rebounder throws a quick, long outlet pass to a teammate, who
throws another quick, long pass to another teammate. That player catches the pass near
the center restraining circle, dribbles to the top of the key and shoots. The Lead moving to
new Trail does not have enough time to get a good look at the shot. The Trail moving to new
Lead recognizes that and makes the judgment on the shot, even though a shot attempt at
the top of the three-point line is normally covered by the Trail.
When that type of transition play occurs near the end of a period, the new Lead judges
whether or not the shot was a three-pointer, but the Trail still judges whether the shot was
released in time.

CORER & TIMER
MOMENTARY STOP
TO OBSERVE
There are times when officials get beat downcourt on fastbreaks – especially in a Crew of
Two. While not ideal, the transitioning Lead can utilize a “button-hook” to get the best possible
angle to officiate the play.
Before transitioning from Trail to Lead, the official must be certain the play is moving to the
other end. Leaving an official to officiate much of the play alone is not a good practice.
While in transition, the new Lead should restrain from sprinting as fast as possible (out-
of-control) to stay ahead of players.  Rather, it may become needed to allow players to pass,
observe and pause the initial play at the goal.
The position shown in the MechaniGram above is merely temporarily and allows the covering
official the best possible angle to make a ruling before moving to the Lead’s base position.
When in this temporary position, the official must be alert to other players on the court and
work to create as little disturbance as possible to the play.
THE BUTTON HOOK

When play moves from one end line toward the other, the Trail has primary responsibility
in the backcourt. However, when there is defensive pressure in the backcourt, sometimes
the Lead must help.
When there are four or fewer players in the backcourt, the Trail should work that area
alone. If there are more than four players in the backcourt, the Lead should work to assist
the Trail.
When there is more than four players in the backcourt, the Lead is positioned near
the division line. If all the players are in the backcourt, the Lead may move closer to the
backcourt end line for better angles. If some players are in the frontcourt, however, the
division-line area is the best position.
When near the division line, the Lead must stay wide and constantly glance from
backcourt to frontcourt. That “swivel” glance allows the Lead to help the Trail with
backcourt traffic plus watch players in the frontcourt.
The Lead should be ready to help on long passes and possible infractions involving the
division line. The Lead will also cover quick breaks and long passes, keeping the players
boxed in.

If there is defensive pressure, the Trail should hand the ball to the thrower.
If there is no defensive pressure, the Trail should bounce the ball to the thrower.  The
Trail may bounce the ball across the lane.
If play is resumed after a stoppage (charged time-out, injury, etc.) with a throw-in

THROW-IN BELOW FREE THROW LINE
The Lead has primary on-ball coverage when the ball is below the free-throw line

by bouncing the ball to the thrower. This means the Lead and Trail will not have to switch or
move across the court to administer a throw-in below the free-throw line extended.
In order for the Lead to administer the sideline throw-in, significant coverage
adjustments must be made. The Lead must move closer toward the sideline before
bouncing the ball to the thrower to ensure a proper visual field that includes the thrower
and throw-in plane. The Lead should also get deep (move back away from the end line)
to increase the field of vision and see secondary coverage of post play on the low block
(MechaniGram).
With the Lead focused nearer the throw-in, the Trail must move off the opposite sideline
and onto the court to officiate all off-ball action, including action in the lane area. The Trail
must be aggressive if an off-ball foul in the lane is detected, moving toward the foul to
close the distance. The Trail is also responsible for mirroring the “start clock” (Signal 1) of
the Lead.
As with all throw-ins, the Lead and Trail should make eye contact before the Lead
bounces the ball to the thrower.
Keep in mind the Lead administers throw-ins below the free-throw line extended when
the ball goes out of bounds on the Lead’s side of the court. If the ball goes out of bounds
below the free-throw line extended on the Trail’s side of the court (opposite the Lead), the
Trail administers that throw-in. There is no need for the Lead to come across the court
to administer that throw-in because the Trail would also have to cross the court to apply

1. Delay momentarily after signaling the foul at the spot to ensure there is no continuing
action or trash-talk among the players.
2. Do not worry about the basketball. Many times the ball will bounce away from the
area. It is not the responsibility of the offi cial to chase it. Going after the ball leaves players
unattended.
3. Once the immediate area appears calm, the Lead clears all the players by running
around them toward the reporting area. Offi cials should not run through a crowd and lose
sight of the players.
4. Stop and square up to the scorer’s table in the reporting area. Make eye contact with the
scorer before communicating and do not get too close to the table.
5. Give clear, crisp signals.
The non-ruling offi cial also has specifi c duties during the dead ball:
1. Keep all players in view. Close down toward the crowd of players slightly — maybe just
a step or two depending on where the players are. During that dead-ball time, the non-ruling
offi cial can prevent many extracurricular illegal activities from brewing into bigger problems.
The non-ruling offi cial should use their voice to let players know they are there; the mere
presence of an offi cial can help prevent a problem from occurring.
2. If the players appear calm, begin moving toward the throw-in spot or begin preparing
players for free throws. The non-ruling offi cial should move slowly, with their head up,

## 4.8 Reporting Fouls And Switching

In free-throw situations (shooting or bonus), the switches will vary depending upon the
official’s spot on the court. The calling official will always assume the Trail position tableside
for all free throws.
In MechaniGram A, the tableside Lead official calls a foul on the low block that will
result in free throws. The Lead will report the foul and then assume the new Trail position
tableside. The Trail opposite the table will freeze and then move to the Lead position
opposite the table to administer the free throws. The new Lead will get the players lined up
while the new Trail reports the foul. The new Lead then confirms the number of attempts
with the new Trail prior to bouncing the ball to the shooter.
In MechaniGram B, the Lead official opposite the table has whistled a shooting foul.
The Lead will move to report the foul and then assume the Trail position tableside. The old
tableside Trail will move to the new Lead position, opposite the table, to administer the free
throws.

LEAD MOVEMENT
Before administering the free throw, the Lead has the ball and is positioned in the lane
under the basket. The Lead should look for late-arriving substitutes at the scorer’s table and
beckon them in, if appropriate. Signal the number of remaining free throws to the players in
the lane and the free thrower. Simultaneously verbalize the number of free throws. Before
bouncing the ball to the free thrower, make sure there are no players moving into or leaving
lane spaces.
When the free thrower is ready to catch the ball, bounce the ball to the free thrower.
The Lead is positioned approximately four feet from the nearer lane line well off the end
line. That position is maintained regardless of the number of free throws.  As the Lead is
taking their position, they should signal number of free throws to be awarded to the official
scorer.
After the shot is airborne, the Lead should adjust position along the end line a step or two
to get a good angle on strong-side rebounding.

SHOT
The Trail administers a silent and visible 10-second count with the arm farthest from
the basket. When showing a visible count as a Trail during a free-throw attempt, the count
should be less demonstrative than a normal visible count so as to not distract the shooter
and draw unnecessary attention to the official.
On the last free throw, use the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2) with open hand raised
directly above the head immediately after the shooter releases the shot. Use the same arm
(farthest from the basket) to ensure the timer clearly sees the signal. During the flight of the
try and with the arm still raised, close down slightly toward the end line. That movement
ensures good angles on rebounding action. If the shot is good, lower the arm. If the shot is
no good and the ball is to remain live, use the “start clock” signal (Signal 1) as soon as the
ball is touched by or touches a player.
There is no need to signal a successful free throw.

When the Trail remains near the free-throw line, back up farther toward the sideline
than normal positioning to ensure all players near the division line can be seen. There is no
need to be in tight like during a normal free throw because there are no players along the
lane line. The Trail’s primary responsibility is the remaining nine players and the benches;
secondary responsibility is the free thrower.
After a technical foul, the throw-in shall be administered at the division line opposite the
scorer’s table.

# Part 5: Game Procedures for a Crew of Three Officials

Game Procedures – Crew of Three
The three-official system is designed to provide better coverage by all three officials.
This coverage gives more emphasis on primary areas of responsibility, thus eliminating the
possible trend of over or under officiating. Always having an official in position acts as a
deterrent to fouling and therefore promotes better basketball. The advantages of having the
Lead and Trail officials on-ball and the Center official with off-ball responsibly:
1. Enhances the ability of three officials to be in the proper position to monitor play and
all players.
2. Provides improved court coverage, in both front and backcourt.
3. Treats both sides of the court the same in regard to areas of coverage.
4. More clearly defines specific areas of coverage and responsibility.
5. Enhances the officiating procedures of wide triangle coverage.
6. Demands total concentration of the officiating crew.
7. Allows the officiating crew to do a better job of officiating contact situations.
8. Provides more effective coverage in pressing and full-court situations.
9. Ensures PCAs are the same for both sides of the court.
10. Advocates a stronger teamwork approach to officiating and requires that officials put
trust and confidence in their partners.
11. Increases the technique of ball side officiating by allowing the Lead and Trail to
officiate the ball and the players who are between them.
12. Increases proper off-ball coverage because the Center official has the responsibility
for off-ball screens, backside coverage and weak-side rebounding.
13. Ensures the officials adjust their positions to the ball and the players on the court.
14. Increases the opportunity for all three officials in the crew to become more involved
and participate in officiating the game.

The officials should ensure both teams are notified three minutes prior to the start of the
second half. During the halftime intermission, the officials shall return to the court for the
second half, the officials will stand across the court (U1 observes the home team and U2
observes the visiting team) until the one-minute mark. At that time, the U2 will secure the
ball and bounce it to the R. The R will take a position with the ball at the division line on the

There should be no visiting with coaches or players unless it is to confer about a game
situation. The officials are then responsible to count the players when the teams return to
the court to begin play. Use preventive officiating to make sure there are five players on the
court per team.
The throw-in to start the second, third and fourth quarters shall be administered by the R
at the division line opposite the table. The R indicates jersey color and direction, designates
the throw-in spot, sounds the whistle to alert players that play is about to begin and places
the ball at the thrower’s disposal.

## 5.1 Pregame, Intermission, Time-Outs

CREW OF THREE
TIME-OUTS PROVISIONS:
1. If a player or head coach requests a time-out while the ball is live, ignore the request if
the ball is in control of an opponent or not in control of either team.
2. If the request is during a dead ball or during a live ball that is in control of the requesting
player or a teammate, it shall be granted.
3. No time-out may be granted during an interrupted dribble.
4. The opponents may not be granted a time-out once the ball is at the disposal of the
thrower for a throw-in or the ball is at the free-thrower’s disposal.
5. Do not grant a time-out after a foul until the necessary information has been reported to
the scorer.
6. Do not grant a time-out until an injured or disqualified or player directed to leave the
game has been replaced.
7. After the free thrower has the ball or the ball is at the disposal of the thrower on a throw-
in, the thrower or a teammate may request and be granted a time-out, but the opponent
may not.
8. After a successful free throw or field goal, any player or head coach may request a time-
out, until the non-scoring team secures the ball for the throw-in. Once the official begins
the 5-second count, the scoring team cannot be granted a time-out.
9. If an official erroneously grants a time-out request, it is not a team infraction. The time-
out will be granted and charged but there is no other penalty assessed.
10. A request for an excess time-out shall be granted, but it is penalized with a team
technical foul.
11. If opponents simultaneously request a time-out during a dead ball, charge a time-out to
each team (or better, hear or see one request before the other).
12. The official may suspend play to permit a player to correct or replace displaced
eyeglasses or contact lens without charging a time-out.
REPORTING PROCEDURES:
1. Sound the whistle while giving the stop the clock signal.
2. While moving to the reporting area, look for verification from the head coach as to what
type of time-out is to be charged. Communicate the type of time-out using the proper
signal. A 60-second timeout is the default when none is declared by the head coach.
3. A non-ruling official should ensure that the non-timeout-calling team is aware of the type
of time-out being granted.
4. Within the reporting area, then signal the type of time-out being granted, Signal 11 for
a 60-second time-out and Signal 12 for a 30-second time-out. Verbally state the team
color, verbally and visually give the player number or head coach (indicate by forming the
shape of a “C” with the hand) making the request. Allow players reasonable time to get
to their time-out areas, then point to the timer and verbally instruct the timer to begin the
time-out period.
5. Notify a coach when that team has used its allotted time-outs.
INJURY/BLOOD:
1. If a player is injured, an officials’ time-out shall be declared when necessary. When
appropriate, bench personnel should be beckoned at the first opportunity. If bench
personnel enters the court (beckoned or not), the injured player must leave the game

until the next opportunity to re-enter by rule (game clock properly starts) unless a time-
out is requested and granted by that player’s team.
2. Officials should never touch an injured player.
3. Any player who exhibits signs, symptoms or behaviors consistent with a concussion
(such as loss of consciousness, headache, dizziness, confusion or balance problems)
shall be immediately removed from the game by the officials and shall not return to play
until cleared by an appropriate health care professional.
4. If a player is apparently bleeding, has an open wound, an excessive amount of blood on
the uniform or has blood on their person (if not resolved within the allowed 20 seconds),
that player shall be directed to leave the game and may not re-enter until the bleeding/
blood has been taken care of. The same re-entry procedures as above apply. NOTE: The
head coach may take a timeout to address the issue or substitute for the player.

benches. Hold those positions until both teams start to come onto the court. As both teams
are coming onto the court, U1 and U2 can move to the proper jump ball locations and the R
can prepare for the game’s opening jump ball.
Note: The R can toss the jump ball or designate one of the umpires to toss if that official

POSITIONING
U1 takes a position on the tableside sideline, approximately 28 feet from the end line to
the left of the R. U1 is primarily responsible for calling back a poor toss, signaling the clock
to start when the tossed ball is legally touched and counting the home team players. U1
also watches both jumpers.
U2 takes a position on the sideline opposite the table, approximately 28 feet from the
end line and on the opposite half of the court U1 is on. U2 is responsible for the position and
action of the nonjumpers and counting the visiting team players.
The R should allow ample time for the players to get settled into their spots around the
center restraining circle. While that occurs, U1 checks with the table personnel to ensure
they are ready. Before entering the center restraining circle, the R makes eye contact with
U2 first, then U1. By checking with U2 first and U1 last, if there is a problem at the table
that needs immediate attention, the R will be facing U1, making it easier for U1 to get
the attention of the R. U1 signals to the R that table personnel and U1 are ready to go. All
officials make sure the teams are facing the correct direction.
While still outside the circle, the R notifies both team captains that play is about to begin.
The R then verbally states the jersey color of each team and indicates the direction of its
goal for the first half. The R blows the whistle with a sharp blast before entering the circle,
then removes the whistle from the mouth prior to tossing the ball.
Before the toss, U1 uses the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2). The R tosses the ball high
enough so the players tap the ball on its downward flight. The U1 starts the clock when the
ball is legally touched. If the toss is poor, any official should immediately sound the whistle,
signal the game clock should not start and re-administer the jump ball.
U1 and U2 must maintain a wide field of vision while the R administers the toss. The
U2 is primarily responsible for the position and action of the eight non-jumpers. The R is
primarily responsible for the position and action of the two jumpers.

5.3 Court Coverage
SCORER & TIMER
In the frontcourt, each offi cial has a primary coverage area. Those areas of coverage do
not change regardless if the offi cial is on the ball or off the ball. When the ball comes into
an offi cial’s primary coverage area, that offi cial is on ball.  When the ball leaves a particular
offi cials’ primary coverage area, that offi cial is off ball.
• The Trail’s responsibilities include the area to the far free-throw lane line extended,
above the free-throw line, to the division line and the sideline nearest the Trail. The Trail
also has three-point coverage on 60 percent of the court. The Trail has primary three-second
responsibility when offi ciating off-ball.
• The Center’s responsibilities include the area from the near free-throw lane line extended
to the division line, the sideline nearest the Center and half of the lane itself. The Center
also has three-point coverage on 40 percent of the court. The Center has primary three-second
responsibility when offi ciating off-ball.
• The Lead’s responsibilities include half of the lane, free-throw line extended to the
three-point line down the to end line on the Lead’s side of the court. The Lead has primary three-
second responsibility on offensive players in the lane when the ball is above the free-throw line
extended.
Five-Second Closely-Guarded Count: Offi cials are responsible for a silent and visible
fi ve-second closely-guarded (within 6 feet) count (Signal 9) within their PCA. During this
count, if the ball moves out of an offi cial’s PCA, that offi cial shall maintain the count until
the count is appropriately ended. Anytime a count restarts (going directly from a holding to
a dribbling count or a dribbling to a holding count), the offi cial shall switch hands/arms.
BASIC FRONTCOURT COVERAGE

Every offi cial on the court is responsible for particular boundary lines in a
halfcourt setting. The Lead and Center are responsible for only one line, while the
Trail is responsible for two.
• The Lead is responsible for the frontcourt end line.
• The Center is responsible for the sideline nearest the Center.
• The Trail is responsible for the sideline nearest the Trail and the division line.
If the ball goes out of bounds and the covering offi cial needs help, that offi cial
should fi rst stop the clock (Signal 2) and look in the direction of the nearest
offi cial likely to have an angle and verbalize “help.” If the non-ruling offi cial has
defi nite knowledge, that offi cial will verbally and visually signal the appropriate
ruling (no conference between offi cials). The primary offi cial will then mirror this
information.
If a non-ruling offi cial has defi nite information regarding an out-of-bounds
ruling that has been made by a crewmate, that non-ruling offi cial goes to the
ruling offi cial and provides the additional information. If the ruling offi cial makes
the decision to change the ruling, the ruling offi cial is the one to sound the
whistle and signal the change.

THREE-POINT RESPONSIBILITIES
In the frontcourt, the Trail is responsible for 60 percent of the three-point line, up to
the far lane line and down to the end line. The Center is responsible for the three-point
line from the near lane line down to the end line. The Lead does not have three-point line
responsibility except when helping in transition.
On three-point attempts, only the covering offi cial should indicate the attempt (Signal
18). The indication should be made with the arm closest to the center of the court so the
table personnel can see it better. The covering offi cial should also signal if the attempt is
successful.
If the Trail signals a successful three-point attempt, the Center mirrors the successful
signal. If the Center signals a successful three-point attempt, the Trail mirrors the signal.
There is no need to mirror an attempt signal.

SCORER & TIMER
Double whistles are more likely to occur in areas where coverage intersects, such as in
the lane, near the free-throw line and near the free-throw line extended.
Generally, the offi cial who has primary coverage at the time of the whistle should make
the ruling.
If the secondary offi cial has a ruling that occurred before the primary offi cial’s ruling or
has information that should be discussed with the primary offi cial, the secondary offi cial
should close into the play quickly toward the primary offi cial. The outside offi cials (Trail and
Center) should be patient with signals on plays to the basket.
Keys to managing double-whistles:
1. Give the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2) and refrain from giving an immediate
preliminary signal.
2. Make good eye contact with each other.
3. Understand where the play originated.
4. Understand each position’s PCA.

CRASH

PASS/CRASH IN LANE
Drives to the basket when the ball handler passes the ball to a teammate then crashes
into a defender below the free throw line are known as “pass and crash” situations.
If the passer sends the ball out toward the Trail, the Trail will follow the ball and the
Center and Lead will stay with the crash. If the ball is passed toward the Center’s side of
the floor, the Center will follow the ball while the Trail and Lead momentarily stay with the
crash.
The Center or Trail official should close down toward the end line to get a better view of
the play, but should be aware of the kickout pass and should make sure they are not too
close to an ensuing three-point attempt.
Once the Lead official determines that a drive down the lane is imminent, the Lead
should move toward the close-down position along the lane line (as shown in the
MechaniGram) to get a better view of the activity in the lane.

SCORER & TIMER
Rebound coverage in a three-person crew has the same basic principles of a two-person
crew. A shot taken from an offi cial’s PCA dictates that offi cial stays with the shooter then
focuses on rebounding action. When a shot is taken from outside an offi cial’s coverage
area, that offi cial should immediately pay attention to the rebounding action.
The third offi cial on the court simply adds another set of eyes for rebounds. That
extra set has a specifi c area to focus on. Those areas are very similar to basic frontcourt
responsibilities, with one main difference: overlaps in coverage.
As the MechaniGram shows, there are areas on the court where two offi cials have the
same rebounding coverage area.
While any offi cial can call a foul during rebounding action, the Trail and Center offi cials
are primary on pushing fouls when offensive players crash the boards. The Lead should
not call those fouls as the Lead does not have the proper perspective the Center and Trail
offi cials have. The Lead, however, can have a foul such as illegal contact or holding that is
better seen from the end line.
If the shot attempts originates from the Trail’s coverage area, the Center offi cial becomes
primary on goaltending and basket interference. Likewise, if the shot originates from
the Center’s area of coverage, the Trail then becomes primary for goaltending or basket
interference.

When shots are taken from the strongside, each official has certain responsibilities.
In MechaniGram A, the shot is taken from the Lead’s coverage area. The Lead is
responsible for the shooter and strong-side rebounding. The Trail should also help with

A three-person crew has an official on both sidelines. Having both sidelines covered
allows the Trail and Center to stay near the sideline, as seen in the MechaniGram. Staying
near the sideline not only takes away the possibility of getting caught in the play, but also
opens the angle of the entire court allowing for better coverage.
There may be times in which a temporary one- or two-step adjustment onto the court or
along the sideline is necessary to avoid straightlining or feeling “pinched” along the sideline
(when players are too close) or when all of the action is far away from the wing official.
STAY NEAR SIDELINE

On trys, the Trail and Center should close down and not bail out. When bailing out, as
the Trail does in MechaniGram A, the Trail puts pressure on the rest of the crew to officiate
rebounding. Instead, the Trail and Center should step down toward the end line when
trys are attempted. That helps the crew better officiate rebounding action as seen in
MechaniGram B. Closing down can help officials avoid bailing out on plays.

OFFICIATING THE DELAY OFFENSE
The delay offense, sometimes referred to as the “spread” or “four-corner” offense,
requires officials to change their basic positions. The delay offense spreads players out to
all corners of the frontcourt and is designed to run the clock down while avoiding double
teams.
When a team goes into a delay offense, the wing officials may have to officiate from
outside the court, as seen in the MechaniGram, to keep wide triangle coverage. That way,
the players have enough room to maneuver without using an official as a screen. It also
keeps officials out of the passing lanes.

In the backcourt, the new Trail is responsible for the backcourt end line and the sideline
on that side of the court. The Center is responsible for the sideline on the Center’s side of
the court. The Lead is responsible for the frontcourt end line.
In a pressing situation, the Center should also be prepared to help out the Trail on any
activity involving the division line. Many times, a quick pass to a teammate near the division
line will not give the Trail enough time to get up the court and get a proper angle on the
play. The Center is close enough to rule on any such action and penalize any backcourt
violations that might occur.

CREW OF THREE
When play moves from one end line toward the other, the Trail has primary responsibility
in the backcourt. For example, when there is no defensive pressure, after a made basket,
the Trail is responsible for the throw-in and watches the players move until they get to the
division line. Once all players are in the frontcourt, normal frontcourt coverage areas apply.
The Trail should remain behind the players at all times, even if there is no defensive

the Center is in perfect position to help. The free-throw line extended position can vary
depending on the location of the players. The Center must move to a spot along the sideline
that gives the Center the best angle to officiate. The Center is responsible for the action of
players in the backcourt, such as illegal screens or holding.
The Center should stay in position after a successful goal just long enough to observe

5.4 The Lead Position
In three-person crews, the strong side would ideally be ball side at all times. While that
is not possible, the Lead can move along the end line and make the strongside the ball
side. The Lead must anticipate a drop pass into the low post on the opposite lane line
when the ball is near the free-throw line extended. In MechaniGram A, the Lead is near
the lane line opposite the play and does not have a good angle.
In MechaniGram B, the Lead has rotated by moving across the end line to the lane line
on the Center’s side of the court to clearly see the post play.
Offi cials should keep their head and shoulders turned toward the players in the lane
when moving. Remember, offi cials still have responsibilities for watching screens and
other action in their PCAs. Offi cials should move with purpose, but under control and with
eyes on the primary off-ball area.
The Lead moves for two reasons: The Lead is in a better position to see the play clearly
(if the Lead stayed on the off-ball side, the Lead would be looking through bodies and
guessing) and the Lead is closer to the play.
If a trap occurs near the division line on the Center’s side of the court, the Center
should move toward the division line to immediately offi ciate the play and the Lead
should initiate a rotation. If the Lead does not rotate, the Center should go back to a
normal Center position when play permits. The Trail or Center can facilitate a rotation, but
only the Lead initiates a rotation.
BALL-SIDE MECHANICS

CREW OF THREE
Positioning under the basket is a danger area for the Lead. An offi cial should never be
positioned directly under the basket because nothing can be seen or offi ciated from there.
The Lead can get caught under the basket when initiating a rotation and moving ball side as a
player takes a shot. For example, the Lead moves ball side anticipating a drop pass into the post.
Instead, a shot is quickly taken while the Lead is moving ball side. Now, the Lead must get out
from under the basket and establish good rebounding angles.
When caught under the basket, the Lead must go back where the Lead came from because
the rotation was not completed before the shot was attempted. If the Lead continues with the
rotation during the try, partners might not catch a rotation occurred and end up in the wrong
positions. A rotation is not complete until the Lead offi cial crosses the farther lane line.
In the MechaniGram, the Lead begins the rotation and moves ball side to watch low post
action. When the Lead is halfway through the lane, a shot is taken. Instead, after the shot, the
Lead should back out from under the basket until the Lead is again in good position to watch
rebounding action.
To know when a shot is being attempted, the Lead can read off-ball players’ movements and
should avoid watching the shooter. Off-ball players in the lane area will begin to obtain rebound
positioning when a shot is airborne.

WIDE ANGLE/CLOSE DOWN
There are two basic starting positions for the Lead on the end line. When the ball is on
the Lead’s side of the court, the Lead establishes a wide-angle position, which is two to
three steps inside the three-point line line extended off the court as seen in MechaniGram
A. When the ball is in the middle of the court or on the Center side of the court, the Lead
establishes a close-down position which is one step outside the free-throw lane line
extended off the court, as seen in MechaniGram B. The close-down position makes it easier
for the Lead to rotate.

CREW OF THREE
When the ball drops below the free-throw line extended on the Lead side of the court, the
Lead’s main responsibility is to watch the post players on the near low block. Officials too
close to the low block do not have a wide angle and may not have the proper perspective.
For a wide angle and better perspective, officials should back off the end line and move
toward the sideline. Shoulders should not be parallel to the end line; they should be angled
slightly. That movement increases the field of vision and provides an opportunity to see
both areas.
In MechaniGram A, the Lead is too close to the play and is not close enough to the
sideline.
In MechaniGram B, the Lead is in better position after moving off the end line, moving
closer to the sideline and angling the shoulders. With that improved position, the Lead has a
better perspective on low block action and is not on top of the play, which makes officiating
the low-block area easier.
MOVEMENT TOWARD SIDELINE

LEAD HELP ON THREE-POINT TRY
In a halfcourt setting, the Lead does not signal a three-point try or successful attempt.
However, in transition that is not always the case. If a quick transition puts the ball in the
frontcourt followed by a quick three-point attempt, the Center and Trail may not be in
position to properly rule on a three-point try. In such cases, the Lead can rule whether or
not the try is attempted from behind the three-point line, as seen in the MechaniGram.

5.5 The Center Position
SCORER & TIMER
The normal starting point for the Center in a halfcourt setting is free-throw line extended.
That is just a starting point though and it is not the only location the Center can be. The
Center can move comfortably up and down the sideline from the top of the key extended to
the second lane space mark extended, as seen in the MechaniGram.
Movement within that range allows for the Center to open angles and does not alter the
positions or responsibilities of the Lead and Trail. It is the accepted range of motion for the
Center.
The majority of the Center officials will move out toward the division line at any
opportunity. Officials should stay lower and possibly step down toward the end line instead
of up toward the division line. Angles will open up on off-ball coverage and will be far better
from that spot on the court.
RANGE OF MOVEMENT

SCORER & TIMER
When the majority of the players are on the far side of the lane, the Center may need to
temporarily move one or two steps onto the court, as in the MechaniGram. It does not do
any good to have the Center stay chained to sideline if there are not any players to officiate.
By moving onto the court one or two steps, the Center is not only closer to the players,
but will have a better angle on off-ball fouls.
When the Center is on the court and play comes back toward the Center, simply move
back to the sideline and the normal location for the Center position.

## 5.5 The Center Position

CREW OF THREE
OPEN ANGLES
When play comes directly at the Center who is standing on the sideline, most angles and
depth are lost. It is difficult to officiate plays when officials are too close to them.
The Center can and should move to maintain an open angle. Otherwise the Center will
become straightlined. The Center can step up toward the division line or down toward the
end line, as in MechaniGram A.
The same emphasis holds true when an offensive player with the ball in the Center’s
coverage area turns the corner and drives the lane. The Center must maintain the proper
angle on that drive and that may mean moving onto the court a step or two to keep it, as in
MechaniGram B. Officials who stay in the same place and do not move often do not see the
whole play. Officials should always strive to create the best possible angles.
OPTION B
OPTION A

Though rare, there will be instances when action is going to occur and the calling official
is not going to know what happened. That occasionally happens on out-of-bounds calls.
The Center must be ready to help.
In MechaniGram A, the Lead is watching a screen. The Center has on-ball coverage and
is responsible for the ball. In MechaniGram B, the pass is not handled cleanly and goes out
of bounds on the end line.
The Lead official, still watching the screen, sees the ball go out of bounds but does not
know who touched it last. The Lead should blow the whistle and immediately look to the
Center and verbalize “help” to see who caused the out-of-bounds violation. The Center will
know which player caused the ball to go out of bounds and should make the call.
Because the Lead was watching the Lead’s PCA, and with some communication by the
Center, the play can be called correctly, without sacrificing off-ball coverage.

TROUBLE SPOT
A trouble spot for the Lead develops when a player with the ball on the low block spins
toward the middle of the lane away from the Lead. The quick spin move often leaves the
Lead straightlined and without a good look on the play.
Many times, a defender near the free-throw line will drop down into the lane and
challenge the move toward the basket. This is when the defender will likely slap at the
offensive player, trying to poke the ball away. That steal attempt is sometimes a foul — one
that goes unseen by the now-straightlined Lead.
The Center must help out and watch the area in the lane when a post player spins away
from the Lead. Commonly referred to as the Lead’s “backside,” the Center has a much
better look at the play after penetrating toward the end line for an improved angle, as seen
in the MechaniGram.

5.6 The Trail Position
SCORER & TIMER
When an official gets too close to a play, that official’s view of the play is distorted, as
shown in the MechaniGram.
When the official moves, that official creates proper spacing and can see all of the items
involved in the play (ball, defender, hands).
SPACING

CREW OF THREE
The officials in the Trail and Lead positions will normally officiate all play in a halfcourt
game on the strong side. With the ball in the frontcourt above the free-throw line extended,
the Trail is responsible for on-ball coverage. The Trail will officiate from the outside-in,
assuming a position that is perpendicular to the ball whenever possible, as in MechaniGram
A. Officiating from the outside-in allows the Trail to see as many of the 10 players as
possible while officiating on the ball. It allows the Trail to dictate the Trail’s angle instead of
taking the angle given by the players. When there is defensive pressure on the perimeter,
before the ball clearly crosses the lane line closest to the Center, the Trail will step onto the
court to get a better angle, or open look, on the play.
When the ball is too near the sideline, the official will move onto the court and officiate
from the inside-out, as seen in MechaniGram B, or up toward the division line. Once that
matchup dissolves, the officials should move back toward the sideline closer to the home
position.

SCORER & TIMER
SHOT
The Trail has more responsibilities than simply watching the shooter. Too often a shot
goes up and the Trail’s first thought is to start moving to the other end of the floor to avoid
getting beat down court. When the Trail leaves, the Lead and Center are left with offensive
players crashing the boards and defensive players doing all they can to grab the rebound.
The Trail must help with rebounding action. When a player takes a jump shot within the
Trail’s coverage area, the first responsibility is to watch the airborne shooter all the way
back to the floor to ensure there are no offensive or defensive fouls. While watching that
action, the Trail should be moving a couple of steps toward the end line, as shown in the
MechaniGram.
Once everything is okay with the shooter and surrounding action, the Trail steps toward
the end line allow the Trail to help the Lead by watching rebounding action. A step or two to
improve an official’s angle is all that is necessary to successfully watch rebounding action.
The Trail is likely to see an offensive player pushing (or crashing into) a defensive player
from behind — something that is difficult for the Lead to see from the end line.
Resist the urge to sprint to the other end of the floor when the shot goes up. Move
toward the end line to get rebounding angles.

CONCENTRATE ON OFF BALL
One of the many keys to successful three-person officiating is knowing when to
watch off-ball and when not to. When the ball is not in an official’s PCA, that official must
concentrate on off-ball action.
In the MechaniGram, the Lead has on-ball coverage. The Trail must concentrate off-ball
and observe the actions of players away from the ball. If the Trail were to watch the ball
while it is in the Lead’s PCA, that leaves only the Center to watch the other eight players.

5.7 Rotations
SCORER & TIMER
“CLOSE DOWN”
As a guideline and depending on playing action, the Lead should close down and may
move laterally to ball side when the ball is near the free-throw lane line extended nearest
the Center. When the Lead moves laterally across the end line (initiates a rotation), activity
in the lane must still be observed by the Lead.
“Close down” means the Lead moves from an area along the end line on the Lead’s
side of the court to the free-throw lane line nearest the Lead, as seen in the MechaniGram.
Often, closing down means a lateral movement by the Lead of a few feet.
CLOSE DOWN

CREW OF THREE
The Lead should rotate when the ball is near the free-throw lane line extended in the
Center’s coverage area. The Lead must read the playing action and anticipate ensuing plays
to rotate properly, as seen in MechaniGram A.
If the ball is on the wing just entering the Center’s area and the Lead does not anticipate
post action or a drive to the basket, there is no need to rotate.
If the ball is near the free-throw lane line extended and the Lead senses ensuing post-
play action (such as a post player moving ball side) as seen in MechaniGram B, the Lead
must initiate a rotation to get in better position to officiate the post play. By not rotating, the
Lead makes the Center work harder by officiating a lot of action in a short amount of time.

CENTER INITIATES
In most cases during a game, the Lead dictates the rotation. However, there is a notable
exception.
When a player with the ball is trapped near the division line on the Center’s side of the
court it is a difficult area to officiate. When that happens, the Center must move up toward
the division line to get in better position to officiate that defensive trap, as seen in the
MechaniGram. Once that happens, the other two officials must pick up on the Center’s
movement, then rotate accordingly. With the Center becoming the new Trail, the Trail drops
down and becomes the Center and the Lead shifts over to ball side.

CREW OF THREE
The Center must officiate all the action when the ball is near the free-throw lane line
extended nearest the Center until the Lead can move laterally across the floor to accept
responsibility to cover the play, as seen in MechaniGram A.
The Center will probably be officiating on the ball prior to any rotation for a brief period of
time. In order to maintain better coverage, the Center may need to pause while rotating to
Trail. Temporarily, there are two Center officials. Complete the rotation when play permits,

In the MechaniGram, the Lead has called a foul on the defender in the low post. At that
time, the Lead must do a number of things:
1. Delay momentarily after signaling the foul at the spot to ensure there is no continuing
action or inappropriate conversation among the players.
2. Do not worry about the basketball. Many times the ball will bounce away from the
area. It is not the responsibility of the offi cial to chase it. Going after the ball leaves players
unattended.
3. Once the immediate area appears calm, the Lead clears all the players by running
around them toward the reporting area. Offi cials should not run through a crowd and lose
sight of the players.
4. Stop and square up to the scorer’s table in the reporting area. Make eye contact with
the scorer before communicating and do not get too close to the table.
5. Give clear, crisp and confi dent signals.
6. Use a strong voice that is audible to the table and both benches.
The non-ruling offi cials also have specifi c duties during the dead ball:
1. Keep all players in view. Close down toward the crowd of players slightly — maybe
just a step or two depending on where the players are. During that dead-ball time, offi cials
can prevent many extracurricular illegal activities from brewing into bigger problems.
Offi cials should use their voices to let players know they are there; the mere presence of an
offi cial can help prevent a problem from occurring.
2. If the players appear calm, begin moving toward the throw-in spot or begin preparing
players for free throws. Offi cials should move slowly, with their heads up, watching the
players as they move. Offi cials should have the players ready for the next play, so that the
ball will get back in play quickly and smoothly.

5.11 Free Throws
SCORER
COVERAGE
The Lead watches players on the opposite lane line (closer to the Center) for potential
violations, etc. The Lead also watches the lane space nearest the end line on the lane line
nearest the Lead. The Lead is the administering offi cial during all free throws and is to
bounce the ball to the thrower before backing out of the lane. For all free throws, the Lead
should be positioned approximately 4 feet from the nearer lane line and well off the end
line. As the Lead is taking their position, they should signal number of free throws to be
awarded to the offi cial scorer.
The Center observes players on the opposite lane line (closer to the Lead) except the
opposite low block area. The Center also watches the free-throw shooter. The Center
administers a silent and visible 10-second count with the arm farthest from the basket
using “wrist fl icks.”  When showing a visible count as a Center during a free-throw attempt,
the count should be less demonstrative than a normal visible count so as to not distract the
shooter and draw unnecessary attention to the offi cial.
On the last free throw, the Center uses the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2) immediately
after the shooter releases the shot. Use the same arm (farthest from the basket) to ensure
the timer clearly sees the signal. During the fl ight of the try and with the arm still raised,
close down slightly toward the end line. That movement ensures good angles on rebounding
action. If the shot is good, lower the arm. If the shot is no good and the ball is to remain live,
use the “start clock” signal (Signal 1) as soon as the ball is touched by or touches a player.
The Trail watches all lane activity to assist the Lead and Center, but also watches any
action above the three-point line.
There is no need to signal a successful free throw.

CREW OF THREE
On all free throws, the Trail shall be positioned near the 28-foot mark, as shown in
MechaniGram A. If possible, the Trail should not obstruct the view of the scorer or timer.
The Trail is primarily responsible for holding and beckoning substitutes and any other table
activity. The Trail should also observe all players in the backcourt.
If necessary to get away from a boisterous coach or volatile situation, the Trail may move
onto the court, as shown in MechaniGram B.

CENTER/TRAIL MOVEMENT
During the flight of the last free throw, the Center and Trail close down slightly toward
the end line. That movement ensures good angles on rebounding action. The Center
is responsible for weak-side rebounding and the Trail is responsible for strong-side
rebounding.

CREW OF THREE
When a technical foul is called, the three officials should switch, just as they would with
any foul. Technical foul free throws are administered in the same manner as other free
throws: the Lead administering the free throws, the Center observing the free-thrower
and the Trail on or near the division line to observe the remaining nine players, as seen in
MechaniGram A.
After all free throws have been attempted, the Center will move up the court to the
division line and administer the throw-in opposite the scorer’s table, becoming the new
Trail. The Trail will move down toward the end line to become the new Center and the Lead
will move along the end line to balance the floor, as seen in MechaniGram B.
The calling official always has the option of going opposite if the situation is potentially
heated.
Note: Non-shooting players do not have to be behind the division line.

5.12 Substitutions
When substitutions are coming into the game, the official responsible depends on
the location of the officials and where and how the ball will become live. During all
substitutions, the responsible official should blow the whistle (if needed to get attention)
and hold the “stop clock” signal (Signal 2) while beckoning substitutes.
• Throw-in with the ball staying in the frontcourt: In most situations, the official nearest
the table is responsible.
• Throw-in with ball going from backcourt to frontcourt: If tableside, the new Lead
beckons the substitutes and then passes substitution responsibilities on to the Center, as
seen in MechaniGram A. If the new Lead is opposite the table, the Center has all substitution
responsibilities.
• Prior to last free throw: The Trail has substitution responsibilities.
• Trail administering throw-in tableside: The Center has substitution responsibilities even
though the Center is across the court from the scorer’s table as seen in MechaniGram B.
The Trail may not see the substitutes and the Center has the best view of the scorer’s table.
• Trail administering throw-in opposite the table: The Center has substitution
responsibilities.
The key to smooth substitutions is for all officials to have good communication, including
eye contact.

OFFICIALS’ PREGAME CONFERENCE
The following pregame conference is designed for a crew of three but can be adjusted
accordingly for a crew of two:
A. Review New Rules
B. Review New Points of Emphasis
C. Review New Mechanics and Signal Changes
D. Review Previous Year’s Rules Changes
E. Conference with Table Officials: Equipment; special court considerations; new rules
1. Scorer: Reporting; good eye contact; substitutions; substitution for disqualified/injured
player; give disqualification information immediately; confirmation that game is over and
there are no problems.
2. Timer: Time-outs, interval for disqualification or injury.
F. Game Management
1. Review all dead-ball situations.
2. The guidelines regarding hand-checking, post play, illegally bumping cutters, traveling,
palming the ball, illegal screens, three seconds and off-the-ball coverage must be
emphasized in the pregame meeting before every game.
3. Stay consistent as a crew throughout the game.
4. Stay with the play after ruling a foul or a violation.
5. Know game situations.
G. Clock Management: Check game clock; starting and stopping; be aware of
mistakes/malfunctions.
H. Basic Rotation/Court Coverage:
1. On-/off-ball coverage/areas of intersection.
2. All officials in frontcourt before Lead rotates. Lead may use accelerated pace in
rotation – doesn’t have to finish, but do not stop in Center of lane. Do not rotate when
a try for goal is in flight, stop and return. Late rotations put crew members in poor
rebounding coverage.
3. Officiate the new area of responsibility immediately.
EXCEPTION: If the Center has started the five-second closely guarded count and the
Lead has rotated to the Center side, the Lead needs to continue to officiate in the
free-throw lane until the Center stops the five-second count. Be patient in starting the
five-second count.
4. Free-Throw Coverage
I. Lead Position:
1. In transition – wide-angle (2-3 steps inside arc) or close-down (1 step outside lane)
position, two or three steps off end line.
2. Take a position near the free-throw lane line extended – May step into free-throw

lane extended one or two steps on drives from Center’s side or down middle; primary
coverage for Center; secondary coverage for Lead.
3. Primary focus is post play – stay in your PCA, may assist where official’s PCA overlap
when OBVIOUS.
J. Center Position:
1. Establish home position – free throw line extended and on or near the sideline.
2. Move to improve angles of coverage: movement area typically goes top of free throw
semi-circle to second lane space.
3. Drive to basket, officiate the play all the way to the basket.
Includes primary, secondary and all defenders.
K. Trail Position:
1. Establish home position – near 28-foot mark and on or near the sideline.
2. Trail must officiate in the post when the Lead picks up ball at the free throw line
extended and below.
3. Officiate where Lead cannot; stay wide; move to improve angles of coverage; monitor
secondary defenders on drives to the basket.
4. Free Throw – Position at the 28-foot mark unless players in backcourt; the Trail must
trail players in transition.
L. Double Whistles:
1. Do not assume your partner’s ruling, confirm/affirm.
2. Double whistles belong to primary; release or help when requested.
M. Crew Communication:
1. Competitive or potential match-up concerns.
2. Help rulings: out of bounds, 2- vs. 3-point try, tipped ball, count/cancel field goal.
3. Signals – the language of the game.
4. Shooters – confirm who they are.
5. All delay of game and head coach warnings are recorded in the scorebook.
6. Time-outs: do not gather unless late-game, or quarter-ending situations arise.
7. Last-second try for goal. Officials should not sound the whistle at the end of a quarter/
period unless the try is not released before the sounding of the horn or a violation
preceded the release of the try.
N. Challenging Rulings/Situations:
1. Jump ball and held balls.
2. Illegal screens; consider location and timing of the screener.
3. Traveling; identify the pivot foot.
4. Out-of-bounds; request or offer help.
5. Tripping.
6. Illegal or excessive contact – defense and offense.
7. Secondary defenders.
8. Double personal/technical fouls; intentional; flagrant; fights.
9. Consider intentional fouls on fast-break situations.
10. Always know the location/status of the ball and player.
OFFICIALS’ PREGAME CONFERENCE

O. Free Throw Administration:
1. Players occupying free-throw lane line spaces may enter the free-throw lane upon the
release of the ball. Do not permit players in early – on the lane lines, enter on release; all
others enter when ball contacts ring.
2. Lead – administers all free throws, responsible for near free-throw lane line space and
all spaces along the opposite free-throw lane line.
3. Trail – responsible for table officials, substitutes, perimeter rebounding, goal tending,
basket interference.
4. Center – responsible for free thrower, opposite free-throw lane line spaces two and
three, goal tending, basket interference, starting clock when an unsuccessful free throw
is legally touched.
P. Time-Out Responsibilities:
1. Reporting, to the scorer, the team and player or head coach requesting/being granted
the time-out and the type of time-out.
2. Reporting warning horns to the head coach and players.
3. Positions during time-outs.
Q. Crew Discussion:
1. Rules questions/clarifications.
2. Game situations.
3. Officiate PCA when ball goes away, PCAs and field of vision zones.
4. Patient whistle: blocked shots, rebound situations, rulings out of your PCA must be
obvious.
5. Concentrate and focus throughout the entire game.
6. Game horn sounding: If the horn is sounded, officials may recognize it and stop play
with a whistle, even to the extent of declaring that the ball did not become live because
of the whistle. The horn may be ignored if it is sounded after the throw-in has started.
R. Conference/State Requirements:
1. Uniform
2. Reports
3. State Championship End-of-Game Monitor Review: A state association may permit
game or replay officials to use a replay monitor during state championship series
contests to determine if the ball is released on a try for goal at the expiration of the game
clock in the fourth quarter or any extra period (0:00 on game clock) should be counted
and if so, determine if it is a two- or three-point goal.
**a.** Obtain instructions from the state association/tournament director regarding
specific guidelines and procedures for use with this rule.
**b.** The covering official should always signal and communicate this ruling on the
court prior to any monitor review.
