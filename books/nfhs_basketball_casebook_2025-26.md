Foreword
The basketball case book has been designated as an official supplement to the rules book by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). The case book is universally used by officials who are interested in basketball game administration; by coaches and by instructors as a textbook for directed study by basketball squads; and in sports officiating courses.
Basketball leaders in all sections of the country have contributed accounts, reports and summaries of situations in games under their jurisdictions. Many of the play RULINGS and COMMENTS are from the files of the NFHS. Much assistance has been given by the executive staffs of the member state high school associations and all who use this book in their basketball training program.
Case Book Format
A1 and B1 are players of Team A and B respectively. A2 is a teammate of A1.
Unless stated, all plays involved a two-point field goal or try and not a three-point goal or try.
The play numbers identify the primary Rule, Section, Article of the rules book which supports the interpretation. Play numbers are designated with a "decimal" whereas a rule reference is shown with a "dash." Example: 7.6.1 is the case book play and 7-6-1 is the rules book reference.
New or Modified Play RULINGS: Part One – All material in Part One is new. Part Two – All plays which have been revised or which are new are
shaded
. All material has been brought up to date to correlate with the current rules.
General Information
The interpretations and RULINGS for all play situations have been approved by the rules committee and are official. Additional interpretations may be secured from your state association office. The NFHS will assist in answering rules questions from state associations whenever called upon. Questionable points will be relayed to the editor of the basketball rules.

PART I
Interpretations on the 2025-26 Rules Changes
4.6.1 SITUATION:
During a fast break, A1 drives to the basket and attempts a layup. As the ball contacts the backboard and bounces toward the ring, B1 slaps the backboard forcefully, causing vibration. The ball rolls off and does not enter the basket.

**RULING:** 
This is basket interference by B1. The vibration caused by slapping the backboard while the ball was in the cylinder and touching the backboard interfered with the shot. Award two points to Team A.

**COMMENT:** 
This type of play is now classified as basket interference, not a technical foul, unless the act is deemed excessive or unsporting. (4-6-1a, 4-6-1b, 9-11-1)
4.22.1 SITUATION:
Late in the fourth quarter, A1 attempts a layup. The ball is on its downward flight, entirely above the level of the ring, and has a possibility of entering the basket. (a) B4, a defensive player, jumps and touches the ball before it reaches the basket. (b) A3, an offensive teammate of A1, jumps and touches the ball before it reaches the basket.

**RULING:** 
In (a), this is goaltending by the defensive player. The ball was on its downward flight, above the ring, and had the possibility of entering the basket. Award two points to Team A. In (b), this is not goaltending. Goaltending applies only to defensive players. However, if A3 touched the ball while it was on or within the basket cylinder, offensive basket interference would apply.

**COMMENT:** 
This rule change clarifies that goaltending can only be committed by defensive players. Touches by offensive players are instead evaluated for potential basket interference. (9-12-1)
4.22.3 SITUATION:
A1 drives toward the basket and attempts a layup. The ball contacts the backboard. (a) The ball continues on an upward arc and still has a realistic chance to enter the basket when B2 jumps and touches it. (b) The ball deflects away from the basket with no realistic chance of scoring when B2 jumps and touches it.

**RULING:** 
(a) This is goaltending by B2. Once the ball contacts the backboard and still has a chance of entering the basket, a defensive player may not touch it. Award two points to Team A. (b) No violation. If the ball clearly has no chance of scoring after contacting the backboard, touching it is legal.

**COMMENT:** 
The ball is considered to be on its downward flight after contacting the backboard. This rule provides a consistent standard to protect legitimate scoring opportunities. (9-12-1)
4.34.1 SITUATION:
The Team A head coach requests a time-out following a goal. (a) The official grants the time-out but has not yet notified the timer to begin the time-out. During this brief interval, A3 walks toward the bench and makes an inappropriate comment to an official. (b) The official properly notifies the timer, and the time-out begins. A3 then makes an inappropriate comment while heading to the bench area.

**RULING:** 
In (a), A3 is still considered a player because the

<!-- Page 4: Page 4 -->

time-out has not officially begun. The unsporting act results in a player technical foul. In (b), A3 is now considered bench personnel. The action results in a bench technical foul and an indirect technical charged to the head coach.

**COMMENT:** 
The designation of a player versus bench personnel hinges on when the time-out officially begins. This affects the type of technical foul charged and the responsibility of the head coach. (10-5-1)
7.5.4 SITUATION:
A1 is dribbling in the frontcourt when the head coach of Team A is granted a time-out. (a) The deflection occurs while A1 is inside the three-point line. (b) A1 is outside the three-point line.

**RULING:** 
In (a), since the stoppage occurred on or within the three-point line, the throw-in spot is the end line, 3 feet outside the lane line on the same side of the floor. In (b), since the stoppage occurred outside the three-point line, the throw-in shall occur from the sideline at the 28-foot line on that side of the floor.

**COMMENT:** 
The updated rule uses the three-point line as a visible boundary to determine throw-in locations, for fouls, violations (other than out-of-bounds violations), and other stoppages, replacing the previous use of imaginary diagonal lines.
9.2.12 SITUATION:
Team A is awarded a throw-in on the end line. A1 is the designated thrower. (a) A1 legally completes the throw-in but delays returning to the court, remaining out of bounds to allow a screen to develop, then re-enters and becomes the first to touch a pass from A2. (b) A1 delays returning, but another player (A2) controls the ball before A1 touches it.

**RULING:** 
In (a), A1 has violated the rule by purposefully delaying re-entry and being the first to touch the ball. This is a violation. Award the ball to Team B. In (b), no violation. Although A1 delayed returning, A2 touched the ball first, so the conditions for a violation are not met.

**COMMENT:** 
To constitute a violation under this rule, a player must both delay their return and be the first to touch the ball. Intent and timing are key factors in enforcement.

Shaded
text indicates a new play in Part 2 or a revised play RULING.

# Rule 1 – Court and Equipment

center restraining circle
1.3.1
SITUATION:
Team A's court has a center restraining circle that (a) is a solid color different than the natural color of the court; (b) has a 2-inch-wide shadow-bordered line; (c) has a ¼-inch wide solid line.

**RULING:** 
Legal in (a), (b) and (c).
SHADOW LINE
1.3.2 SITUATION:
A team mascot logo is painted in the center restraining circle. The host school used multi-colored paint for the continuous lines over the team mascot logo in the center restraining circle.

**RULING:** 
The area within these lines need not be of one color, but the continuous line must be clearly visible.
RECTANGULAR BACKBOARD-PADDING SPECIFICATIONS
1.9.1 SITUATION:
What are the rule requirements for padding on rectangular backboards?

**RULING:** 
The rule provides that all rectangular backboards shall be padded with material at least 2 inches thick on the bottom and side edges and extend a distance of 15 inches up the sides from the bottom. The edges of the board on front and back must be padded on the bottom and 15 inches up the sides with at least 1-inch-thick padding that extends ¾ inch up or in from the edge. The padding may be any single, solid color, but shall be the same color on both backboards.
GAME BALL
1.12.3 SITUATION:
The game ball supplied by the home team does not have the NFHS Authenticating Mark. The visiting team does have a ball with the NFHS Authenticating Mark. Must the referee accept the visitor's approved ball for game use?

**RULING:** 
Yes, the home shall provide a ball that meets specifications in order for it to be used. The referee shall be the sole judge of the legality of the ball and may select a ball provided by the visiting team. A current list of NFHS Authenticating Mark balls can be found on the NFHS website.

<!-- Page 6: Page 6 -->

TEAM BENCH LOCATION
1.13.1 SITUATION:
Upon arrival on the court, the visiting team is advised its team's substitutes will have to go considerably farther than the home team to reach the reporting area. The visiting coach complains to the referee.

**RULING:** 
The referee has no authority to move the location of either bench, unless it involves player safety. Obviously, it is intended that the benches be on the floor-level seats or bleachers and that the team benches be approximately the same distance from the table whenever possible. The referee should report the unusual bench location to the state association office.
COACHING BOX LOCATION

### 1.13.2 SITUATION A :

Safety regulations prevent the adopted 28-foot coaching box from reaching the end line. May the coaching box be located 32 feet from the end line to give the full 28 feet allowed for the coaching box?

**RULING:** 
No, with state association approval, the coaching box may be located at a spot different from the prescribed 28 feet from the end line. The coaching box cannot be any farther than 28 feet from the end line and may not extend beyond the end line.

### 1.13.2 SITUATION B :

Safety regulations prevent the adopted 28-foot coaching box from reaching 28 feet from the end line. May the coaching box be located: (a) 26 feet from the end line and extend 28 feet toward the end line; (b) 14 feet from the end line and extend to the division line?

**RULING:** 
No in (a), the coaching box may not extend beyond the end line and may not be longer than 26 feet; and in (b), the coaching box may start less than 28 feet from the end line and extend to the end line. With state association approval, the coaching box may be located at a spot different from the prescribed 28 feet from the end line. The coaching box cannot be any farther than 28 feet from the end line and may not extend beyond the end line.

### 1.13.2 SITUATION C :

Officials arrive at a contest with a court length of less than 84 feet. There are no lines on the floor for the coaching box. Where should the coaching box be marked?

**RULING:** 
On a court of less than 84 feet, the coaching box should be marked from the division line 14 feet toward the end line. The coaching box will extend from that mark toward the end line based on the state association's permitted coaching box length. In this case, because the court is not 84 feet, the box may be shorter than 28 feet. On a court that is 84 feet in length or more, the coaching box will be marked from the end line 28 feet toward the division line. A mark off the court on the sideline is placed at the 28-foot line and another mark off the court at the end line will indicate the end of the coaching box if the state association adoption is a 28-foot coaching box.
MUSIC/NOISE/SOUND RESTRICTIONS
1.18 SITUATION:
In (a), the band from the home team is playing during a live ball; (b) the electronic scoreboard is playing broken-glass sound effects just after an opponent's missed field-goal attempt; or (c) fans from the visiting team are

<!-- Page 7: Page 7 -->

using artificial noisemakers during an opponent's attempted free throw.

**RULING:** 
All situations are prohibited by rule. The officials should notify game management in (a) to instruct the band to only play during the permitted times; in (b) to instruct the scoreboard operator to cease the prohibited acts; and in (c) to have a public-address announcement made stating that the use of any artificial noisemakers is prohibited at all times. In all situations, if the problem continues it may result in a technical foul being assessed to the team supporter(s).

# Rule 2 – Officials and Their Duties

video replay monitor

### 2.2.1 SITUATION A :

During a state championship series contest in which the state association has authorized the use of video replay, A4 releases a try as time expires in a tie game; the try is successful. The covering official rules that the attempt was still in A4's hands when time expired and waves off the basket, forcing overtime.

**RULING:** 
Since the try occurred at the end of the game, with zeros on the game clock, a review is permissible. The replay official, in consultation with the game officials, rules that the shot was released prior to the expiration of time. The game officials count the basket and declare Team A the winner.

### 2.2.1 SITUATION B :

Prior to the game, the home team athletic director informs the officials that the school has purchased a new state-of-the-art scoreboard with video replay capabilities to review end-of-game situations.

**RULING:** 
The video replay equipment shall not be used. Video replay is only permitted by authorization of the state association at the conclusion of state association championship series contests. (2-2-1 Note)
JURISDICTION

### 2.2.4 SITUATION A :

The score is Team A-62 and Team B-61 when the horn sounds to end the fourth quarter. Prior to the referee's approval of the final score, the coach of Team A directs obscene gestures at the officials.

**RULING:** 
A technical foul is charged for unsporting behavior and the result of the free throws will determine which team wins or whether an extra period is required. (5-6-2 Exception 4, 10-5-1c)

### 2.2.4 SITUATION B :

Time expires to end the game with a score of 64-61. Immediately following the signal to end the fourth quarter, the officials are moving off the court toward a door to their dressing room. The referee enters the door and is in the hallway to the locker room, but the umpire is still in the court area when the umpire notices the scorer frantically trying to get the officials' attention due to a possible scorebook error.

**RULING:** 
Since one of the officials has not left the visual confines of the playing area, the game jurisdiction has not ended. The officials may work with scorer's table personnel to rectify any errors.

<!-- Page 8: Page 8 -->


### 2.2.4 SITUATION C :

Team B leads by a point with seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. A1 releases the ball on a try, but the noise level makes it difficult for the covering official (umpire) to hear the horn. The umpire signals a successful goal. The referee definitely hears the horn before A1 releases the ball, but does not realize the umpire counted the goal. The officials leave the visual confines of the playing area and are not aware of the controversy until the scorer comes to the officials' dressing room.

**RULING:** 
Even though the referee could have canceled the score if the officials had conferred before leaving, once the officials leave the visual confines of the playing area, the final score is official and no change can be made. In situations such as this, it is imperative that officials communicate with each other and that they do not leave until any problem regarding scoring or timing has been resolved.
SUPPLEMENTARY EQUIPMENT
2.4.3 SITUATION:
Prior to the game, the home team athletic director informs the officials that the school has purchased a new timing system whereby the game clock is controlled by the game officials via their whistle and a timing pack.

**RULING:** 
The device shall not be used unless the state association has approved its use and the game officials have been properly instructed/trained on how to use the equipment. (2-4-3 Note)
GAME-TIME NOTIFICATION
2.4.4 SITUATION:
Following pregame warm-ups, Team A returns to its dressing room. The referee has each team notified three minutes before the game is scheduled to begin. Despite this notification, Team A delays the start of the game for nearly two minutes by not returning to the court. The referee determines there is no excusable reason for Team A's tardiness.

**RULING:** 
Team A is charged with a technical foul for delaying the start of the game by a minute or more. (10-2-1a)
COACHES VERIFICATION OF PROPER UNIFORMS/EQUIPMENT

### 2.4.5 SITUATION A :

Before the contest both coaches verify that their teams are legally equipped. In the third quarter A1 is discovered wearing a ring.

**RULING:** 
A1 must leave the game and remove the jewelry and may re-enter the game at the next substitution opportunity, but no penalty is assessed against A1 or the coach.

### 2.4.5 SITUATION B :

To the referee's pregame inquiry of coaches regarding all team members being legally equipped and wearing the uniform properly, both coaches responded "yes." Three minutes into the first quarter, U1 observes A5 with a tongue stud.

**RULING:** 
When the tongue stud is noticed, A5 must leave the game and may not return until the stud has been removed. There is no technical foul assessed. (3-5-7)

<!-- Page 9: Page 9 -->

CONCURRENT JURISDICTION

### 2.6 SITUATION A :

The umpire observes traveling, stepping out of bounds or another violation by A1. At approximately the same time, A1 tries for a field goal or the referee observes contact by B1 on A1.

**RULING:** 
The officials must decide definitely which act occurred first. There is no rules coverage to administer the acts as occurring simultaneously. If the violation occurred first, the ball became dead. If the ball was in flight during the try before the touching of the boundary, there was no violation. If the contact occurred after a violation was observed, it is not a foul unless the contact is intentional or flagrant.

### 2.6 SITUATION B :

A violation and personal contact occur at about the same time. Both are observed by the same official, or the violation is observed by one official and the contact by the other. What is the proper procedure?

**RULING:** 
The officials shall decide which occurred first. If the violation was first, it caused the ball to become dead; hence, the contact which followed was not a foul unless intentional or flagrant. If the contact occurred first, it caused the ball to become dead and no violation occurred.
SIGNAL FOR POINT(S)
2.7.8 SITUATION:
During the course of the game, the officials: (a) do not signal successful two-point field goals or free throws; or (b) do signal the value of point(s) resulting from defensive goaltending or basket interference.

**RULING:** 
This is proper procedure. Officials are not authorized to signal the point value for two-point goal or free throws. However, it is necessary to signal in cases of doubt or confusion and when point(s) are awarded. Officials shall also continue to signal a successful three-point goal.
UNSPORTING BEHAVIOR
2.8.1 SITUATION:
What guidelines should be exercised by the officials when spectators' actions are such that they interfere with the administration of the game?

**RULING:** 
The rules book states "the official may rule fouls on either team if its supporters act in such a way as to interfere with the proper conduct of the game." It is significant to note the word used is "may." This gives permission, but does not in any way imply that officials must rule technical fouls on team followers or supporters for unsporting acts. Thus, while officials do have the authority to penalize a team whose spectators interfere with the proper conduct of the game, this authority must be used with extreme caution and discretion. While the authority is there, the official must rarely use it, because experience has demonstrated that ruling hasty technical fouls on the crowd rarely solves the problem and may, in fact, result in penalizing the wrong team because the official may not have proper knowledge as to which team's supporters were responsible for the unsporting act.

<!-- Page 10: Page 10 -->

DISQUALIFICATION PROCEDURE
2.8.4 SITUATION:
Who informs the coach when a player is disqualified on fouls?

**RULING:** 
It is recommended that the ruling official be responsible for notification to the coach. The scorer is to indicate to that official when a player has committed a fifth foul (personal and technical) or second technical foul. The official will immediately notify the coach, the timer and then the player of the disqualification. The player is officially disqualified and becomes bench personnel when the coach is notified.

**COMMENT:** 
Once the coach is notified, the disqualified player becomes bench personnel and any subsequent technical foul on that disqualified player is also charged indirectly to the head coach. (2-12-5, 4-14, 10-6-2)
CONCUSSION MANAGEMENT
2.8.5 SITUATION:
A1 and B1 hit heads in diving for a loose ball and both appear injured. However, A1 is immediately removed from the game by the officials as A1 is exhibiting signs consistent with a concussion. Later in the game, A1 reports to the scorer's table to reenter the contest.

**RULING:** 
The rules permit A1 to return to the game once A1 has been cleared by an appropriate health-care professional. The responsibility for obtaining that clearance rests with the coach/school, and need not be verified by the officials (unless state procedures require verification). If A1 appears at the scorer's table to reenter the game, the officials shall assume the coach/school followed the appropriate return-to-play procedures and A1 is eligible to participate.
CORRECTABLE ERRORS

### 2.10.1 SITUATION A :

A1 is fouled with one second remaining in the second quarter. Team A is awarded a throw-in and A1 passes the ball inbounds to A2, the horn sounds ending the quarter. As officials enter the court from the halftime intermission, the scorer informs the referee that A1 should have been awarded bonus free throws.

**RULING:** 
The error is discovered within the correctable error timeframe, and shall be corrected. A1 is awarded bonus free throws with the free-throw lane spaces cleared. Resume play from the point of interruption, which is an alternating-possession throw-in to start the third quarter. (2-10-1a, 2-10-6, 5-6-2 Exception 3)

### 2.10.1 SITUATION B :

A1 is fouled. Team A is awarded the ball out of bounds. The foul was Team B's fifth team foul of the quarter and A1 should have been awarded bonus free throws. Team A scores on the ensuing throw-in. As the ball passes through the net, the officials are informed of the error.

**RULING:** 
The error is discovered within the correctable error timeframe. Count the goal by A; A1 will be awarded the bonus with no players along the free-throw lane lines. There has been a change of team control and the point of interruption is the goal by Team A, therefore Team B will be awarded a throw-in anywhere along the end line. (2-10-1a, 2-10-5)

<!-- Page 11: Page 11 -->


### 2.10.1 SITUATION C :

A1 is fouled but erroneously is not awarded two free throws even though the bonus is in effect. Team A is given a throw-in, and A1 inbounds the ball to A2 who is tied up by B1 resulting in a held-ball situation. The error is discovered following the held-ball call. The possession arrow is pointing to: (a) A's; or (b) B's basket.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the merited free throws will be awarded, and play will continue from that action, since Team A had not lost team control between the error and when the error was recognized. However, in (b), the free-throw lane spaces are cleared for A1's merited free throws, and play resumes from the point of interruption which is an alternating-possession throw-in by Team B.

### 2.10.1 SITUATION D :

A1 has been awarded two free throws. Erroneously, the ball is allowed to remain in play after A1 misses on the first attempt. A2 rebounds the miss and tosses the ball through the basket. B1 secures the ball and inbounds it. Play continues until a foul is ruled on A2 as B is passing the ball in B's frontcourt.

**RULING:** 
The goal by A2 counts, but the error of not awarding A1 a second free throw is no longer correctable. Since the ball remained in play on the missed free throw, the clock started and the ball became dead when the goal was scored. When the ball became live on the subsequent throw-in, the time period for correction had expired. (2-10)

### 2.10.1 SITUATION E :

A1 is fouled by B1 while in the act of shooting and the try or tap for field goal is successful. The administering official erroneously awards and announces two free throws instead of one. A1's first attempt is unsuccessful and B1 rebounds. Play continues briefly with B1 advancing the ball before the official recognizes the error and stops play while B1 is in Team B's backcourt.

**RULING:** 
Since A1 has attempted the merited free throw to which the player was entitled there is no further correction to be made. Play shall resume with a throw-in by Team B at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the ball relative to the three-point line.

### 2.10.1 SITUATION F :

(a) A1; or (b) B1 commits basket interference at Team A's basket. In (a), the referee erroneously counts the score; or in (b), fails to count it. In each case, the error is not discovered until the ball has become live following the dead ball during which the error occurred.

**RULING:** 
The official's error in both (a) and (b) is still correctable.

### 2.10.1 SITUATION G :

A1 attempts a goal from behind the three-point line: (a) but the covering official fails to give the successful signal after the ball goes through the basket, and the scorer records only two points; or (b) and the covering official gives the successful signal, but the scorer records only two points. Team B inbounds the ball and proceeds to score. The coach of Team A goes to the table and requests a 60-second time-out to discuss the error.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the error of not awarding three points is correctable as it was detected prior to the second live ball after the error. The extra point is scored, the 60-second time-out is not charged and the game continues from the point of interruption. In (b), it is a mistake by the scorer which can be corrected any time until the final score has been approved.

<!-- Page 12: Page 12 -->


### 2.10.1 SITUATION H :

A1 jumps and releases a try for goal apparently from behind the three-point line. The try is successful. The covering official does not indicate a three-point try and does not signal three points after the goal. The Team A coach rushes to the table and requests a 60-second time-out to discuss a correctable error. It is determined neither official clearly observed A1's location before the player jumped to try.

**RULING:** 
No change can be made and two points are properly scored. The 60-second time-out remains charged to Team A. (5-8-4)
2.10.2 SITUATION:
B1 fouls A1. Team A is in the bonus, but the official erroneously awards the ball to Team A for a throw-in. A1's throw-in is intercepted by B1 who scores a goal. A1's throw-in is controlled by A2 who dribbles into Team A's midcourt and then asks for a time-out. During the time-out, the scorer advises the referee that Team A was in the bonus when B1 fouled A1.

**RULING:** 
It is too late to correct the error. The error could have been corrected anytime during the dead ball following the goal by B1, as this was the first dead ball after the clock started following the error.

### 2.10.4 SITUATION a :

A1 is fouled by B1 during a field-goal try which is successful. A2 is erroneously awarded the free throw. While A2's successful attempt is in the air: (a) B1 fouls A3; or (b) B1 intentionally fouls A3. Prior to the ball becoming live, the coach of Team B properly asks the referee to correct the error of awarding the free throw to the wrong player.

**RULING:** 
The free throw by A2 is canceled and A1 will properly attempt the free throw which should have been awarded originally. The common foul by B1 in (a) is canceled. The intentional foul in (b) cannot be canceled. In (b), the game continues with the administration of the two free throws to A3 resulting from the intentional foul by B1. Team A will then be awarded the ball for a throw-in. If the corrected error is a free throw by the wrong player, at the wrong basket or the awarding of an unmerited free throw, the free throw and the activity during it other than unsporting, flagrant, intentional or technical fouls are canceled.

### 2.10.4 SITUATION B :

The officials erroneously permit A1 to shoot technical foul free throws at Team B's basket; A1 makes both free throws. When the error is discovered, the timeframe for the correctable error (a) has not passed; or (b) has passed.

**RULING:** 
In (a), cancel the successful free throws by A1 and administer the free throws again at the correct basket. In (b), the free throws by A1 shall not be canceled and count toward Team A's point total.

### 2.10.6 SITUATION A :

A1 is fouled by B1. It is a non-shooting personal foul. It is Team B's fifth foul of the quarter, but the official scorer fails to notify the officials and they award Team A the ball out of bounds. After the inbound pass, Team A misses a shot and Team B secures the rebound. B1 then misses a shot at Team B's offensive end, and A1 secures the rebound. A1 requests and is granted a time-out in Team A's backcourt. During the time-out, the officials are informed that Team A should have been awarded bonus free throws on its previous possession.

**RULING:** 
The error can still be corrected. A1 shoots bonus free throws with no players in the free-throw lane spaces. Team A is then awarded the ball out of bounds at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the ball relative to the three-point line

<!-- Page 13: Page 13 -->

where the time-out was requested. Since the error involves the failure to award a merited free-throw(s) and there has been a change in team control, play shall be resumed from the point at which it was interrupted, after the error has been rectified.

### 2.10.6 SITUATION B :

A1 is fouled by B1. It is a non-shooting personal foul. It is Team B's fifth foul of the quarter, but the official scorer fails to notify the officials and they award Team A the ball out of bounds. After the inbound pass, Team A misses a shot and Team B secures the rebound. While Team B has the ball in its control, B1 is charged with an illegal screen against A2. Before Team A is handed the ball for the throw-in, the officials are informed that Team A should have been awarded the automatic bonus on its previous possession.

**RULING:** 
The error can still be corrected. A1 shoots bonus free throws with no players in the free-throw lane spaces. Team A is then awarded a throw-in for B1's team-control foul and play will continue from that point. Since the error involved the failure to award a merited free-throw(s) and there has been a change in team control, play shall be resumed from the point at which it was interrupted after the error has been rectified.
SCORER'S SIGNAL
2.11.3 SITUATION:
When may the scorer signal?

**RULING:** 
If the scorer desires to call attention to a player who is illegally in the game, the scorer may signal the official when the ball is in control of that player's team. If it is for a substitution, the scorer may signal when the ball next becomes dead and the clock is stopped. If it is for conferring with an official, the scorer may signal when the ball is dead. If the scorer signals while the ball is live, the official should ignore the signal if a scoring play is in progress. Otherwise, the official may stop play to determine the reason for the scorer's signal.
REFEREE'S DECISION

### 2.11.10 SITUATION A :

The official and visiting scorers do not agree on the number of fouls charged to A1.

**RULING:** 
The referee is notified and if the reason for the discrepancy cannot be determined, the referee will accept the record of the official scorebook.

### 2.11.10 SITUATION B :

The scorer fails to record two points awarded to Team A by the official during the first quarter as a result of basket interference by B1.

**RULING:** 
The score may be corrected any time it is discovered before the final score is approved. This situation is not due to the inadvertent setting aside of a rule but is the result of a mistake in record keeping. When there is a discrepancy in the score which is correctable and the referee positively knows what caused the problem, the referee shall order the correction to be made.

<!-- Page 14: Page 14 -->

SCORER'S MISTAKE

### 2.11.10 SITUATION C :

The scorer mistakenly credits a field goal by A1 to B1 and Team B in the second quarter. The regulation game ends with the score tied. During a time-out in overtime, the scorer detects the mistake and advises the referee.

**RULING:** 
The referee will have the mistake corrected. The overtime will continue with the corrected score. Once the ball becomes live in the overtime, the overtime will be played even though a subsequent correction of an error or mistake changes the score. A bookkeeping mistake can be corrected at any time until the final score is approved.
SCOREBOOK
2.11.11 SITUATION:
Team A's scorebook is the official scorebook for the game. Team A's scorer is requested by Team A's head coach to bring the scorebook to the locker room at halftime to review several pieces of information.

**RULING:** 
Prohibited; the scorebook shall remain at the table throughout the game, including all intermissions. There is no specific penalty for removing the scorebook; however, if the officials believe the scorebook was removed as an unsporting act, it could be penalized accordingly. (10-2-4, 10-4-6, 10-5-1)
WARNING SIGNAL
2.12.5 SITUATION:
A4 commits a fifth foul. The official notifies the coach, then signals the timer to begin the 15-second interval for replacing the player and then notifies the player regarding the disqualification. In (a), the required substitute reports within 5 seconds; (b) no substitute has reported by the end of the 15-second interval.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the substitute is beckoned into the game by the officials and play resumes. In (b), the timer shall signal a warning horn at the beginning of 15 seconds and then sound another horn at the end of the 15-second interval. If a substitute is not ready to enter, a technical foul is charged directly to the head coach which results in the loss of the coaching box. (10-6-2 Penalty)
SIGNAL NOT HEARD
2.13 SITUATION:
The signal to end the fourth quarter cannot be heard by the officials. The table officials disagree as to whether the ball was in flight during a try for field goal when time expired or if a foul occurred before the ball became dead.

**RULING:** 
The final decision shall be made by the referee, and unless the referee has knowledge to alter the ruling, the goal shall count if it was successful and the foul shall be charged and penalized. (2-5-5)

<!-- Page 15: Page 15 -->


# Rule 3 – Players, Substitutes and Equipment

NUMBER OF PLAYERS REQUIRED
3.1.1 SITUATION:
After six players have been disqualified, Team A has only four who are eligible to continue in the game as players. In a gesture of fair play, the coach of Team B indicates a desire to withdraw a player so that each team will have four players on the court.

**RULING:** 
This is not permissible. Team B must have five players participating as long as it has that number available. If no substitute is available, a team must continue with fewer than five players. When only one player remains to participate, that team shall forfeit the game unless the referee believes this team still has an opportunity to win the game.
ROSTERS, STARTERS AND NUMBERS

### 3.2 SITUATION A :

Seven minutes before the scheduled starting time for the game, Team A presents its team roster and its starting lineup to the scorer and then, at six minutes prior to the game starting time, Team A presents two additional names to the scorer for the team list.

**RULING:** 
Team A is assessed one technical foul for the violation of not presenting its team member list nor designating its starting lineup at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled game starting time. Team A is also assessed one technical foul for the two names which were added to its team roster six minutes prior to game starting time. (10-1-1, 10-1-2)

### 3.2 SITUATION B :

A1, who is designated as a starter 10 minutes prior to the scheduled starting time of the game, becomes ill or is injured before the game starts.

**RULING:** 
A1 may be replaced without penalty as illness or injury is considered to be an extenuating and unavoidable situation which permits a substitution. A1 would be permitted to enter the game later. (10-1-2a)

### 3.2.2 SITUATION A :

Team A properly submits its team member list and designates its five starters. However, the number for each team member is incorrect. The error is not detected until after the game has started.

**RULING:** 
Only one team technical foul is charged regardless of the number of players and substitutes not wearing the number indicated in the scorebook. Each player must wear the number indicated in the scorebook or change the scorebook number to that which each player is wearing. Any substitutes who become players and require the changing of the number indicated for them in the scorebook will not result in a penalty as the one maximum technical has already been charged to the team for an administrative infraction. (10-1-1 Penalty)

<!-- Page 16: Page 16 -->


### 3.2.2 SITUATION B :

Three minutes before the game starts, it is discovered: (a) two Team B members have wrong numbers in the scorebook; or (b) two Team B team members are wearing the same number.

**RULING:** 
In (a), if either or both team member's number is changed in the scorebook, one technical foul is charged to Team B. If there is no request for change or if neither becomes a player, thus avoiding the change, there is no penalty. In (b), a technical foul is charged to Team B upon discovery of the identical numbers. Only one team member may wear a given number; the other must change to a number not already in use before participating. (10-1-2)

### 3.2.2 SITUATION C :

Team A substitute No. 25 reports to the table for the first time with approximately one minute remaining in the second quarter and is beckoned onto the court. In (a), the ball is put in play by a throw-in from A1 to A2. The horn sounds and the scorer informs the officials that No. 25 is not listed in the scorebook. In (b), No. 25 plays the remainder of the second quarter. During halftime intermission, the official scorer realizes No. 25 is not listed in the scorebook and informs the officials when No. 25 returns to the court before the start of the third quarter.

**RULING:** 
In (a), No. 25 is currently in the game and became a player upon legally entering the court. Since No. 25's name and number must now be entered into the scorebook, a technical foul is charged to Team A. In (b), no penalty is assessed since No. 25 is not currently in the game. If No. 25 attempts to enter the game in the second half, 25's name and number will be added to the scorebook and a technical foul charged to Team A. (3-2-2b, 10-1-2b)

### 3.2.2 SITUATION D :

Team A properly submits its team member list and designates the five starters as required at least 10 minutes before the scheduled start of the game. Anytime thereafter, either before the game starts or during the game, the coach asks the scorer to change a number in the scorebook: (a) so it corresponds to what the team member is wearing; (b) because a player's shirt has excessive blood on it; or (c) because a player's shirt is torn.

**RULING:** 
In (a), a technical foul is charged to Team A. In (b) and (c), the shirt is changed and the number change made in the scorebook without any penalty.

### 3.2.2 SITUATION e :

Team A designates No. 32 as a starter by the 10-minute timeframe prior to the game. In (a), as the teams take the floor for the opening jump ball, the scorer recognizes that No. 34 is on court instead of No. 32 for Team A and notifies the officials. In (b), following about two minutes of play in the first quarter, a time-out is called. The scorer notifies the officials that although Team A No. 32 was a designated starter, No. 34 started instead and is still in the game.

**RULING:** 
In (a), if Team A's coach replaces No. 34 for the correct designated starter, No. 32, no penalty is assessed. If Team A's coach elects to start the game with No. 34 instead of No. 32, a technical foul is assessed to Team A for changing a designated starter. In (b), no penalty is assessed. The infraction had to be discovered and penalized before the ball became live to start the game. Once the ball became live, it was too late to penalize for this specific infraction. (3-2-2a, 10-1-2a Penalty)

<!-- Page 17: Page 17 -->

SUBSTITUTIONS

### 3.3.1 SITUATION A :

During a 30-second time-out, A6 goes to the scorer to substitute for A1: (a) before the 15-second warning signal; (b) after the 15-second warning but before the time-out is over; or (c) as the players break the huddle and take their positions on the court just prior to the signal ending the time-out.

**RULING:** 
The substitution will be allowed in (a), but denied in (b) and (c). As with a 60-second time-out, substitutes must have reported before the warning signal is given.

### 3.3.1 SITUATION B :

A time-out is granted to Team A with play to resume by administration of a free throw. A6 reports to enter after the timer's warning signal has sounded. Since A6 has reported too late to enter, could A6 enter if: (a) either team is granted a time-out; (b) the resumption of play is delayed because a player is injured getting into position for the free throw; or (c) Team A is willing to put A6 into the game with a technical foul?

**RULING:** 
Permissible in (a) and (b), but not in (c).

### 3.3.1 SITUATION C :

Substitute A6 reports to the scorer just after the warning signal is sounded during a time-out. The scorer advises A6 that the player will not be allowed to enter until the next opportunity for substitution. The Team A coach beckons A6 to return to the bench.

**RULING:** 
This is permissible. The substitute is not obligated to remain at the table. However, A6 would have to report again before being allowed to enter the court. If A6 remains at the table, A6 may actually replace any player.

### 3.3.1 SITUATION D :

Intermission has concluded and play is about to resume in the third quarter when the scorer notifies the officials that no Team A substitutes reported prior to the warning horn.

**RULING:** 
The third quarter begins with the same five Team A players that concluded the second quarter. (3-3-1a Note)

### 3.3.1 SITUATION E :

B6 has properly reported to the scorer to enter the game. A1 is then fouled in the act of a three-point try and is discovered to be bleeding and cannot appropriately cover the injury within the 20 seconds allotted for addressing blood on a player or uniform. Prior to the first attempt, (a) B6 and A6, who is replacing bleeding A1, enter prior to the first free-throw attempt; (b) substitutes A7 and A8 report to the scorer's table after B6 and A6 enter the game;

**RULING:** 
In (a), A6 must replace bleeding-player A1 before the free throw is administered, B6 may also enter because the player had legally reported to the table and another player had been directed to leave the game by the official. In (b), A7 and A8 must wait until prior to the last remaining free throw to enter the game. A1 may remain in the game if Team A requests and is granted a time-out and the bleeding can be appropriately addressed.

### 3.3.1 SITUATION F :

Substitutes A6, A7 and A8 report only their own numbers to the scorer for entry. The substitutes are beckoned into the game by an official and enter the court. Before their replacements leave the court, a fight breaks out with five (of the eight on-court) players from Team A and three players from Team B involved.

**RULING:** 
Substitutes become players when they legally enter the court; in this case, when the official beckoned them onto the court. The players being replaced by A6, A7 and A8 were not known at the time of the fight to determine what players would be classified as "bench personnel." The officials

<!-- Page 18: Page 18 -->

and scorer shall make an effort to determine who substitutes A6, A7 and A8 were replacing when the fight broke out. If the players being replaced by the substitutes cannot be determined, the only recourse the officials have to determine what penalties to assess the head coach for the involvement of bench personnel is to assess the maximum penalty. Of the five Team A players involved, assume three were bench personnel and assess three indirect technical fouls to the head coach, which results in ejection. Team B would also be awarded four free throws (two for each additional player involved in the fight). All participants are disqualified for flagrant fouls. Play would be resumed with a Team B throw-in from the division line opposite the scorer's table. (2-3, 10-4-8 Penalty, 10-5-1g Penalty)

### 3.3.3 SITUATION A :

A1 is injured during a play in which A1 has been fouled. As a result, A1 cannot attempt the free throw. Substitute A6 replaces A1 and attempts the free throw which is successful. Substitute A7 replaces A6 before the clock starts.

**RULING:** 
The substitution is legal. (8-2)
ILLEGAL ENTRY

### 3.3.3 SITUATION B :

Team B is charged with a technical foul for an excess time-out. During this stopped-clock interval, A1 is replaced by A6. A1 then returns to the game and attempts the two free throws which are: (a) both successful; (b) both unsuccessful; or (c) one is successful and one is not.

**RULING:** 
Once A1 re-entered, even illegally, and the ball became live, A1 was a legal player at that point. The resulting action in (a), (b) and (c) stands. The situation does not come under the provisions of the correctable-error rule, nor is there any provision for penalizing either Team A or A1. (3-3-4, 8-3)
DIRECTED TO LEAVE GAME – jersey

### 3.3.5 SITUATION A :

B1 fouls A1. Just before A1 goes to the line for bonus free throws, the official observes: (a) A1 pull the jersey out of A1's pants; or (b) A1's pants being worn below the hips.

**RULING:** 
In both (a) and (b), A1 will be directed to put the jersey in the pants or pull up the pants, and must leave the game immediately following the last free throw. The free-throw lane spaces are cleared for the free throws and Team B is awarded the ball for a throw-in, whether or not the last free throw is successful.

**COMMENT:** 
A charged time-out by Team A does not alter the requirement for A1 to leave the game.

### 3.3.5 SITUATION B :

A1 is directed to leave the game because A1's jersey is not tucked into the game pants. The official notifies the Team A coach that a replacement is required. The official then instructs the timer to begin the 15-second replacement interval because a substitute is not made available immediately. Team A's head coach then requests a time-out to keep A1 in the game.

**RULING:** 
Team A's time-out request may only be granted after A1 is replaced by a substitute. A time-out is not permitted to keep a player in the game who has been directed to leave for not wearing the uniform properly. Once A1 is replaced by a substitute, Team A may request and be granted a time-out, if desired. (2-12-5, 5-8-3b)

<!-- Page 19: Page 19 -->

INJURY

### 3.3.6 SITUATION A :

A1 is injured and play is stopped to permit the athletic trainer or physician to administer aid. (a) A1 is removed from the court and replaced within less than one minute; or (b) the injury is such that the physician will not allow A1 to be removed from the court until being certain it is prudent to do so. After approximately five minutes, A1 is moved from the court.

**RULING:** 
No time-out is charged in either (a) or (b), regardless of the amount of time involved. The intent of the rule is to require an injured player to be removed without charging a team with a 60-second time-out, regardless of how much time is consumed prior to removal. A team may request a time-out if it wishes to keep the player (if able) in the game provided the replacement interval for the substitution has not begun. (5-8-2a)

### 3.3.6 SITUATION B :

A1 appears to be injured and an official properly halts play and the Team A coach rushes onto the court to check A1. However, A1 is OK and seems ready to play within a few seconds.

**RULING:** 
A1 must be removed as the coach came onto the court. A1 may remain in the game if the coach does not come on the court, the official does not beckon for the coach or bench personnel to come onto the court, and A1 is ready to play immediately. If the coach or other bench personnel have come onto the court or the official beckons the coach onto the court, the player must be replaced. There is no set amount of time as to what is "immediately," but it should not involve more than a few seconds and it must be without the coach, athletic trainer or doctor being beckoned and/or entering the court. The coach may also request a time-out to keep the player in the game provided the replacement interval for the substitution has not begun. (10-5-2)

### 3.3.6 SITUATION C :

A1 is injured and bench personnel are beckoned onto the court. Once A1 has been removed from the court, the official notifies Team A's head coach that a replacement is required. The coach acknowledges the notification and the official then instructs the timer to begin the 15-second replacement interval because a substitute is not made available immediately. Team A's head coach then requests a time-out to keep A1 in the game.

**RULING:** 
The time-out request must be made when the official informs the coach that a replacement is required. Once the 15-second interval has begun and A1's replacement is pending, a time-out shall not be granted. Once A1 is replaced by a substitute, Team A may request and be granted a time-out, if desired. (2-12-5 Note, 3-3-6 Note 2, 5-8-3b)

### 3.3.6 SITUATION D :

A5 is injured as the horn sounds to end the first quarter and the coach is beckoned by an official on to the court to attend to A5.

**RULING:** 
The intermission should begin when A5 is removed from the court. No substitute is required if A5 is ready to play to start the second quarter. When A5 is not ready, a substitute should report before the warning horn or a time-out may be requested by Team A to keep A5 in the game. (2-12-5 Note)

<!-- Page 20: Page 20 -->

BLEEDING PLAYER

### 3.3.7 SITUATION A :

B1 is directed to leave the game because of excessive blood on the uniform jersey after Team B is given 20 seconds to rectify the situation. Team B does not have any extra jerseys. (a) The coach asks one of the substitutes to give the substitute's jersey to B1; or (b) Team A is able to find a jersey which B1 can wear although it is not exactly the same color or style of the Team B jersey. The jersey will, however, clearly identify B1 as a member of Team B and will not be confusing to either team or the officials.

**RULING:** 
Acceptable procedure in both (a) and (b). In both situations the scorer will make necessary changes in the scorebook without penalty.

**COMMENT:** 
The spirit and intent of the rule is to do everything possible to allow the player to use a different jersey and return without penalty. However, identical numbers shall not be allowed on the same team.

### 3.3.7 SITUATION B :

A1 is bleeding and intentionally wipes blood on the arm of the both B4 and B5. In (a) neither the referee or umpire observes the bleeding or the action of A1; (b) U1 observes that A1 is bleeding from a cut on A1's arm; (c) U1 observes B4 and B5 with blood on their arms; or (d) U1 observes A1 bleeding, and observes A1's action of wiping blood on the arms of B4 and B5.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), when observed, A1 is directed to Team A's bench and is allowed 20 seconds to cover the wound and return to play. If the wound cannot be appropriately covered and blood cleaned within 20 seconds, A1 must leave the game. (c) When observed, B4 and B5 are directed to Team B's bench and allowed 20 seconds to appropriately clean the blood from their arms before returning to the game. If the blood cannot be appropriately removed in 20 seconds, they must leave the game. (d) When observed, A1, B4, and B5 are directed to their team benches and allowed 20 seconds to appropriately cover any wounds and clean the blood from their arms before returning to the game. If the wound cannot be covered or the blood cannot be removed in 20 seconds from any player, that/those player(s) will be removed from the game. A1 is charged with a technical foul for an unsporting act. If in the judgment of U1 the actions of A1 were flagrant, A1 would be disqualified from further competition. Any player or legally entering substitute may attempt the two free throws, after which B will have the ball for a division line throw-in. In all situations, a team may request a time-out to keep a player in the game.

### 3.3.7 SITUATION C :

Officials discover blood on players A1 and B1 simultaneously and direct both players to their bench areas and are allowed 20 seconds to appropriately cover and/or clean blood from the skin or uniform. After the allotted 20 seconds neither player is ready to continue play and are notified by the officials to leave the game, (a) Team A chooses to request a time-out to keep A1 in the game, while Team B elects to substitute B6 for B1; (b) both teams request a time-out to keep A1 and B1 in the game.

**RULING:** 
In (a), B6 must enter the game prior to the official granting the time-out for Team A. A1 must be ready to play by the end of the time-out. B1 may not re-enter the game until the next opportunity to substitute after time has run off the

<!-- Page 21: Page 21 -->

clock. In (b), both teams are charged a time-out and the time-outs run concurrently. If one team requests a 60-second time-out and the other a 30, the duration shall be 60 seconds. Both A1 and B1 must be ready to play by the end of the time-out.
UNIFORMS

### 3.4.1 SITUATION A :

The competing teams in a tournament setting enter the court for warm-ups both wearing dark jerseys. The tournament manager indicates that (a) Team A was aware of the home-team designation and failed to comply with wearing the required white jersey; (b) neither team was notified of the proper home/away designation. However, Team B has both sets of jerseys available.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the Team A head coach receives a direct technical foul. The game starts with two free throws followed by a division line throw-in awarded to Team B and loss of the coaching box for the Team A head coach for the remainder of the game. In (b), Team B should be given ample time to change into its white uniforms. No penalties are assessed. (10-6-4)

### 3.4.2 SITUATION A :

Team B is wearing jerseys which have: (a) a small basketball patch with a No. 12 attached to the upper right front; or (b) a black 2-inch-wide band attached around the shoulder strap. Both items are in memory of an injured teammate.

**RULING:** 
The jerseys in (a) are illegal. The penalty is a technical foul charged directly to the head coach. The jerseys in (b) are legal. (10-6-4)

### 3.4.2 SITUATION B :

Team A members are wearing white jerseys which have (a) a manufacturer's logo in the apex of the neckline; (b) a manufacturer's logo in the side seam.

**RULING:**

**RULING:** 
The color combinations are all legal. It is permissible to use three colors – a solid color in contrast with the jersey color and two different solid-color borders. In (b), the white border is legal and must be counted as one of the two allowable borders. The color/style of the numbers must be the same on front and back.

### 3.4.3 SITUATION B :

A7 reports to the official scorer to enter the game wearing a jersey with the No. 7, which is the number listed in the scorebook. A7 (a) enters the game and participates; (b) changes into a legal jersey and enters the game later; or (c) goes back to the bench and never enters the game.

**RULING:** 
In (a), a direct technical foul is charged to the Team A head coach for the illegal uniform. Team B

<!-- Page 22: Page 22 -->

is awarded two free throws and a division-line throw-in, and the Team A head coach loses coaching-box privileges. In (b), a number must be changed in the scorebook. Therefore, Team A is assessed a team technical foul when the change occurs, but the coach does not lose coaching-box privileges. In (c), no penalty is assessed when the player never enters the game and the scorebook is unaltered. (10-1-2c, 10-6-4)

### 3.4.3 SITUATION C :

Starter, A1, has brought the wrong uniform and with eight minutes on the clock prior to the start of the game, switches with A15 and now is wearing a legal jersey but a new number. With two minutes on the clock prior to the start of the game, it is discovered that starter, B1, is wearing a different jersey than indicated in the scorebook. It is confirmed that a wrong number was provided to the official scorer and a change is made to reflect the correct number in the scorebook.

**RULING:** 
Both Team A and B are charged with an administrative technical foul for changing a number in the scorebook and will begin the game with one team foul toward the bonus. No free throws are awarded and the game will begin with a jump ball.

**COMMENT:** 
When each team is assessed technical fouls in equal numbers before the game, the penalties are charged and they offset. (4-19-8b, 4-36-2c, 10-1-2) (See 6.4.1 SITUATION A)
3.4.4 SITUATION:
Team A is wearing jerseys which have: (a) the school name below the numbers with the lettering starting in the front and continuing around the side to the back; or (b) the school name above the number and the mascot name below the number; or (c) illegal names/logos on the front or back.

<!-- Page 23: Page 23 -->

PLAYER EQUIPMENT

### 3.5 SITUATION A :

The officials are on the court prior to the game observing the team warm-ups. One official notices that a member of Team A is wearing a decorative necklace.

**RULING:** 
The official should inform the team member to remove the jewelry immediately. Upon compliance, the team member may continue to warm up with his or her teammates and may start the game without penalty.

### 3.5 SITUATION B :

May a team member wear: (a) shoes which have a light mechanism or have lights which are activated by heel contact with the floor; or (b) gloves?

**RULING:** 
No, in both (a) and (b). In (a), the shoes may be worn if the lights are deactivated. In (b), gloves are not needed to play the game and are not considered to be appropriate.

### 3.5.3 SITUATION A :

Before the game, officials are watching Team A warm up and notice A3 is wearing a black compression sleeve and white tights.

**RULING:** 
Illegal because the rule requires individual players to wear the same color sleeves and tights. A3 will not be allowed to participate while wearing the different color items. No penalty is involved. A3 simply cannot participate until the color restriction is corrected.

### 3.5.3 SITUATION B :

Substitute A6 reports to enter the game to replace A1. A5, already in the game, is wearing a beige compression sleeve on an arm and leg. A6 is wearing a black headband and wristbands.

**RULING:** 
A6 is not allowed to enter because the rule requires all teammates to wear the same allowable color sleeves, headbands and wristbands. No penalty is involved. A6 simply cannot participate until the color restrictions are corrected.

### 3.5.4 SITUATION A :

Team A's school colors are blue and gold and the predominant color of Team A's jerseys are white. Prior to the game, an official notices that several Team A members are wearing (a) blue headbands and blue wristbands; or (b) beige pre-wrap around the entire head and blue wristbands.

**RULING:** 
Illegal in (a). Illegal equipment in (b); the headband colors do not match the wristband color requirements. The official shall inform the player and the head coach that these items are illegal and may not be worn during the game because they do not meet the color requirements.

### 3.5.4 SITUATION B :

An official notices members of Team A are (a) wearing headbands matching the predominant jersey color that have extensions; (b) wearing hair-control devices such as rubber, cloth or elastic bands or pre-wrap material around hair but not completely encircling the head; (c) wearing rubber or elastic bands around the head that match the predominant color of the jersey; (d) wearing pre-wrap around the head that does not match the predominant jersey color and is not white, black or beige in its original unaltered state; or (e) wearing soft coverings over their heads. The coach indicates these coverings are being worn for religious reasons. The covering for A1 is loose and comes off the player's head during warm-ups, while A2's covering is secured with visible bobby pins.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the headband is illegal as it has an extension; in (b), the hair-control devices would

<!-- Page 24: Page 24 -->

be legal regardless of color; in (c), the hair-control devices must now comply with the headband rule as they go around the head and are, therefore, legal; in (d), the pre-wrap falls under the headband rule and must, therefore, match the predominant jersey color or be white, black or beige. If the pre-wrap does not meet this criteria, it is illegal. Officials should determine colors based on the original unaltered state of the headband. In (a), (c) and (d), the coach should be informed that the players will not be allowed to enter the game wearing these items, and in (e), in both cases, the players will need to secure the coverings to their heads. Players may use flat hair clips, bobby pins or any other hair-control device that does not increase the risk of injury to the player, teammates or opponents. Any other requirements relative to the wearing of these coverings will be provided by each state high school association.
3.5.5 SITUATION:
An official notices that player A1 has rolled the waistband of the shorts and the inner band of the shorts is exposed. The rolling (a) exposes only one manufacturer's logo; (b) reveals multiple manufacturers' logos; (c) reveals no manufacturers' logo; (d) exposes the drawstring of the shorts.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (c), the logos are legal; in (b) and (d), the player may not participate until the multiple manufacturer logos are not exposed or the drawstring is tucked inside the shorts.
3.5.6 SITUATION:
Prior to the opening jump, an official notices (a) A1 is wearing an undershirt with sleeves cut off and hemmed at the shoulders. A2 and A3 are both wearing undershirts with normal length sleeves; (b) A4 is wearing an undershirt with a visible manufacturer's logo/trademark; (c) Team A wearing black undershirts under purple uniforms.

**RULING:** 
All players are wearing legal apparel.

**COMMENT:** 
(a) The rule does not require all players to wear the same length sleeves on their undershirts, but each individual player must have sleeves the same length on an undershirt when worn; (b) A visible manufacturer's logo/trademark is permitted on the undershirt as long as it meets the logo requirements in 3-6; In (c), players on the visiting team may wear black under their dark jerseys, but cannot wear a combination of purple and black.
3.5.7 SITUATION:
Substitute A6 is beckoned and enters the court to replace A1. A6 is wearing: (a) a bracelet, (b) an earring covered with tape or (c) earhole spacer.

**RULING:** 
The items in (a), (b) and (c) are illegal and considered jewelry and A6 will not be allowed to participate while wearing the items. No penalty is involved. A6 simply cannot participate until the illegal items are removed.
UNIFORMS – LOGO
3.6.1 SITUATION:
A6 enters the game with an excessive manufacturer's or school's logo on: (a) socks, (b) wristbands or (c) jersey.

**RULING:** 
Legal in (a). In (b) and (c), A6 may not participate and is directed to return to the bench until legally equipped.

**COMMENT:** 
The restriction on visible manufacturer's or school's logo size is in effect on jerseys, uniform bottoms, compression shorts, wristbands and headbands. The shoes and socks are not considered part of the uniform for purpose of visible logo size.

<!-- Page 25: Page 25 -->


# Rule 4 – Definitions

AIRBORNE SHOOTER
4.1.1 SITUATION:
A1 is high in the air on a jump shot in the three-second lane. A1 releases the ball on a try and is then fouled by B1 who has also jumped in an unsuccessful attempt to block the shot. A1's try is: (a) successful; or (b) unsuccessful.

**RULING:** 
A1 is an airborne shooter when the ball is released until one foot returns to the floor. An airborne shooter is in the act of shooting. B1 has fouled A1 in the act of shooting. A1 is awarded one free throw in (a), and two in (b). (4-41-1)
CONTROL – FOR ALTERNATING POSSESSION
4.3.2 SITUATION:
A1 is fouled by B1 just after the ball leaves the official's hand(s) on the jump to start the first extra period of play. Both teams are in the bonus. How is the alternating-possession arrow established?

**RULING:** 
When the bonus is in effect, the possession arrow is set toward the opponent's basket when the ball is placed at the disposal of the free thrower.
4.3.3 SITUATION:
During the jump to start the game, A1 slaps the ball out of bounds. Before the ball is at B1's disposal for a throw-in, B2 is charged with a technical foul.

**RULING:** 
Team A will attempt two free throws followed by a division-line throw-in opposite the table. When the ball is at the disposal of the thrower of Team A, the arrow will be set pointing toward Team B's basket.
BACKCOURT – FRONTCOURT – BALL LOCATION
4.4.1 SITUATION:
As Team A is advancing the ball from its backcourt toward its frontcourt, A1 passes the ball to A2. A2 catches the ball while both feet are on the floor – with one foot on either side of the division line. In this situation, either foot may be the pivot foot. (a) A2 lifts the foot which is in the backcourt and then puts it back on the floor in the backcourt; or (b) A2 lifts the foot which is in the frontcourt, pivots and puts it on the floor in the backcourt.

**RULING:** 
In (a), it is a backcourt violation. When A2, while holding the ball, lifts the foot which was in the backcourt, the ball is now in the frontcourt. When A2's foot then touches in the backcourt, it is a violation. In (b), when A2 lifts the foot which is in the frontcourt and places it down in the backcourt, the location/status of the ball has not changed. The ball is still in the backcourt and no violation has occurred. (4-35-2)
BALL TOUCHES AN OFFICIAL
4.4.4 SITUATION:
The official is in Team A's frontcourt when the official is contacted by a pass thrown by A1 from Team A's backcourt. After touching the official, the ball: (a) goes out of bounds; or (b) rebounds to the backcourt where it is recovered by A2.

**RULING:** 
Touching the official is the same as touching the floor where the official is standing. In (a), the ball is awarded to B for a throw-in. In

<!-- Page 26: Page 26 -->

(b), the ball has been in the frontcourt and then has gone to the backcourt while in Team A's control. It is a violation for A1 to cause the ball to go from A's backcourt to frontcourt and return to backcourt untouched if A1 or a teammate is first to touch it after it has returned to backcourt. (9-9-2)
contacting the backboard and basket interference
4.6.1 SITUATION:
A1 attempts a try for goal from just inside the three-point line. While the ball is in flight and approaching the cylinder, B1 leaps and slaps the backboard hard in an attempt to block the shot. The ball enters the cylinder and contacts the ring while the backboard is still visibly vibrating due to B1’s contact. The shot does not go in.

**RULING:** 
This is basket interference by B1. The vibration of the backboard — caused by a defensive player’s contact — while the ball is in the cylinder and in contact with the ring, meets the definition under Rule 4-6-1a and 4-6-1b. The ball is declared dead immediately, and the goal is awarded to Team A.

**COMMENT:** 
Basket interference occurs when a player causes the backboard or basket to vibrate while the ball is on or within the basket, is touching the backboard, or is within the imaginary cylinder. The timing of the vibration, not just the contact, now determines the violation. [4-6-1a, 4-6-1b, 9-17-1, 10-4-4 (if unsporting)]
TEAM FOULS TO REACH BONUS
4.8.1 SITUATION:
B1 commits a common foul against A1 for Team B’s fifth foul of the (a) first quarter, (b) fourth quarter.

**RULING:** 
In both (a) and (b), A1 is awarded two free throws. In (a), the team fouls are reset at the end of the quarter and in (b), the team fouls do not reset if the game is tied forcing an overtime.

**COMMENT:** 
On a team’s fifth team foul, the bonus rule is in effect. If the foul is a common foul and this is not a player or team control foul, the player fouled would attempt two free throws. The team fouls are reset at the end of each quarter except after the fourth quarter when an overtime is needed.
4.8.2 SITUATION:
(a) A1 is charged with a player-control foul; or (b) a Team A member dunks during the pregame warm-ups.

**RULING:** 
In both (a) and (b), the foul counts as one of the five team fouls to reach the bonus. In (a), the foul also counts toward disqualification.In (b), a team technical is charged and Team B is awarded two free throws plus the ball for a division line throw-in and the head coach does not lose the privilege of the coaching box. (10-2-7, 10-4-3)
continuous motion
4.11.2 SITUATION:
A1 has ended their dribble in the free throw lane and (a) is stepping toward the basket; (b) is pivoting toward the basket. In both cases, B1 fouls A1. In (a), A1 legally finishes their last step. In (b), A1 completes the pivot, before immediately jumping to attempt a try.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), if the try is successful, the goal counts. If the try is unsuccessful, A1 will be awarded two free throws as it was a two-point attempt. A player with the ball is pivoting or stepping when fouled may complete the usual foot or body movement in any activity

<!-- Page 27: Page 27 -->

while holding the ball.

**COMMENT:** 
The try starts when the player begins the motion, which habitually precedes the release of the ball. After a player ends a dribble and is stepping or pivoting toward the goal when fouled, the player should be considered in the act of shooting if the player continues the motion and releases the ball on a try. (4-41-3)
PLAYER AND/OR TEAM CONTROL
4.12 COMMENT:
A player is in control when the player is holding or dribbling a live ball, but team control includes passing activity. When a team secures control, that team continues to be in control until the ball is in flight on a try or tap for field goal, or an opponent has secured control or the ball has become dead. This has an influence on rules such as team-control fouls, three-seconds and frontcourt/backcourt. Team control during a throw-in only applies to fouls committed by the offense. The three second and backcourt violation rules are not in effect when a team is in control of the ball for a throw-in.
The throw-in team remains in control of the ball until player control is established on the court.
No team is in control while the ball is dead, during a jump ball, after the ball has left the hand on a try or tap for field goal, nor during the period which follows any of these acts while the ball is slapped away from other players in an attempt to secure control.
4.12.1
SITUATION A:
A1 drives toward the free-throw lane and goes up in the air for a jump shot. Before A1 becomes airborne, B1 obtains a legal position on the court that is directly in line with A1's drive. (a) Before; or (b) after releasing the ball, A1 illegally contacts B1. In both cases, the ball goes through the basket.

**RULING:** 
A1 has committed a player-control foul in both (a) and (b). There is no goal in either case. Player-control foul provisions in (b) continue until airborne shooter A1 returns one foot to the floor. Team B is awarded the ball for a throw-in at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. (7-5-3b)
4.12.1
SITUATION B:
A1 is dribbling in A's backcourt when the ball accidentally strikes A1's ankle and bounces away. During the interrupted dribble, A1 fouls B1 in attempting to continue the dribble.

**RULING:** 
A team-control foul is charged to A1. It is not a player control foul as the contact occurred during an interrupted dribble. (4-19-7)
4.12.2
SITUATION A:
A1's missed try rebounds directly to A's backcourt where A2 gains control. Is this a violation?

**RULING:** 
No. Both player and team control ended when A1 released the ball on the try. The rebound into A's backcourt was not in control of either team. (9-9-1)
4.12.2
SITUATION B:
During a throw-in by A1 from the end line by Team A's basket: (a) A2 is in the restricted free-throw lane area for four seconds of the throw-in count; or (b) the throw-in is touched by A2 before it goes across the division line into Team A's backcourt where it is recovered by A3.

**RULING:** 
Legal in (a) and (b), even though Team A is in team control during the throw-in. There is no three-second count

<!-- Page 28: Page 28 -->

in (a) since team control had not yet been established in Team A's frontcourt. There is no backcourt violation in (b) since team control had not yet been established in team A's frontcourt before the ball went into Team A's backcourt. The throw-in ends when A2 legally touches the ball, but the backcourt count does not start until A3 gains control in Team A's backcourt. (4-12-2 NOTE, 9-7-1 NOTE, 9-8, 9-9-3 NOTE)
4.12.2
SITUATION C:
With 3.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, A1's throw-in pass is deflected into the air by B1. While the ball is in the air, an official inadvertently sounds their whistle. After the whistle, the game clock still shows 3.9 seconds remaining in the quarter.

**RULING:** 
The clock shall remain at 3.9 seconds, with Team A awarded a throw-in at the out-of-bounds spot nearest to where the ball was deflected by B1. While the ball remains live, a loose ball always remains in control of the team whose player last had control. Team A maintained control, and it will be awarded a throw-in nearest to where the ball last was in contact with a player on the court when the whistle sounded. The officials would not have rule support to take time off the clock as no player on the court ever gained control of the ball (4-12-4, 4-36-2a, 4-42-5a).
DISQUALIFICATION
4.14.1
SITUATION A:
A1 is fouled by B1 while Team A is in the bonus. The covering official is at the table reporting the foul when A1 is charged with a technical foul by the official who is observing the players. The foul on A1 is A1's fifth.

**RULING:** 
A1 is disqualified as both personal and technical fouls are counted. Because A1 has been disqualified, the player will not be allowed to attempt the free throw(s) resulting from B1's foul. The substitute for A1 will attempt the free throw(s). (8-2)
4.14.1
SITUATION B:
A1 is charged with A1's fourth personal foul and reacts by using profanity. The covering official charges A1 with a technical foul.

**RULING:** 
A1 is disqualified. The technical foul brings A1's total fouls to five, which results in automatic disqualification. This technical is not charged indirectly to the head coach, as A1 was not "bench personnel" when the technical foul was charged. (4-14-2, 10-4-6b)
4.14.1
SITUATION C:
A1 is fouled by B2 and is awarded two free throws. The foul is B2's fifth foul. The new trail official reports the fifth foul to Team B's coach. Before a substitute is made, the lead official incorrectly permits A1 to attempt the first free throw. The officials realize the error and huddle to discuss the SITUATION.

**RULING:** 
The result of the first attempt shall stand. Team B's head coach shall be notified of B2's disqualification. Once B2 has been replaced, A1 shall attempt the second free throw.

**COMMENT:** 
This is an official's error and not a correctable error SITUATION according to Rule 2-10. (2-8-3, 6-1-2c, 10-6-2)
4.14.1
SITUATION D:
A1 is fouled by B1 while Team A is in the bonus. In frustration, A1 pushes B1 after the ball becomes dead. A1 is assessed a technical foul. A1 successfully makes both free throws for the personal foul assessed to B1. B3 is ready to attempt the free throw for the technical foul by A1. The official scorer notifies the officials that the technical foul on A1 was A1's fifth.

**RULING:** 
Officials notify the Team

<!-- Page 29: Page 29 -->

A coach and A1 of the disqualification and allow a substitute for A1. The points made by A1 will stand. B3 is allowed to shoot the free throws for the technical foul and Team B is given the ball at half court to continue the game. (2-10-1c, 4-14-1)
DRIBBLE – LEGAL AND ILLEGAL MOVEMENT
4.15 COMMENT:
It is not possible for a player to travel during a dribble. A player is not dribbling while slapping the ball during a jump, when a pass rebounds from a player's hand, when a player fumbles, or when a player bats a rebound or pass away from other players who are attempting to get it. The player is not in control under these conditions. It is a dribble when a player is in control of the ball, bats, throws, or pushes the ball to the floor, and is the first to touch the ball after it returns from the floor. It is not a dribble when a player stands still and holds the ball and touches it to the floor once or more than once.

### 4.15.1 SITUATION A :

While rebounding, A1 touches the ball while trying to gain control, after which: (a) A1 allows the ball to strike the floor to begin a dribble; or (b) A1 catches the ball and then pushes the ball to the floor to begin a dribble.

**RULING:** 
Legal in both (a) and (b). The dribble does not begin until A1 has gained control.

### 4.15.1 SITUATION B :

A1's throw-in pass is beyond A2. (a) A2 reaches out and slaps the ball toward A's basket; or (b) A2 muffs the pass. In both situations. A2 then gains control and dribbles to the basket and scores.

**RULING:** 
No violation in either (a) or (b).

### 4.15.1 SITUATION C :

A1 attempts a pass to A2 during pressing action in A's backcourt. The ball hits B's backboard and deflects directly back to A1 who catches the ball and: (a) passes the ball to A2; or (b) starts a dribble.

**RULING:** 
The pass against B's backboard was the start of a dribble which ended when A1 caught the ball. In (a), the pass is legal action. In (b), it is a violation for a second dribble. (4-4-5, 9-5)

### 4.15.4 SITUATION A :

As dribbler A1 attempts to change directions to avoid guard B1, the dribbler allows the ball to come to rest in one hand in bringing the ball from the right to the left side of the body. A1 pushes the ball to the floor in an attempt to continue the dribble.

**RULING:** 
When A1 palmed/carried the ball, the dribble ended and when the ball was pushed to the floor a violation occurred. (9-5)

### 4.15.4 SITUATION B :

A1, while advancing the ball by dribbling, manages to keep a hand in contact with the ball until it reaches its maximum height. A1 maintains such contact as the ball descends, pushing it to the floor at the last moment; however, after six or seven bounces, A1's hand is in contact with the ball and the palm of the hand on this particular dribble is skyward so that the ball is resting on top of the hand.

**RULING:** 
The dribble has ended and a violation occurs if A1 dribbles again. The dribble ended when the ball came to rest in the palm of A1's hand. (9-5)

### 4.15.4 SITUATION C :

After dribbling and coming to a stop, A1 throws the ball: (a) against the opponent's backboard and catches the rebound; (b) against a referee, immediately recovers the ball and dribbles again; or (c) against A1's own backboard in an attempt to score (try), catches the rebound and dribbles again.

<!-- Page 30: Page 30 -->


**RULING:** 
A1 has violated in both (a) and (b). Throwing the ball against the opponent's backboard or a referee constitutes another dribble, provided A1 is first to touch the ball after it strikes the official or the board. In (c), the action is legal. Once the ball is released on the try, there is no player or team control, therefore, A1 can recover the rebound and begin a dribble.

### 4.15.4 SITUATION D :

While dribbling: (a) A1 bats the ball over the head of an opponent, runs around the opponent, bats the ball to the floor and continues to dribble; (b) the ball bounces away but A1 is able to get to it and continues to dribble; (c) the ball hits A1's foot and bounces away but A1 is able to overtake and pick it up; or (d) A1 fumbles the ball in ending the dribble so that A1 must run to recover it.

**RULING:** 
Violation in (a), because the ball was touched twice by A1's hand(s) during a dribble, before it touched the floor. In (b), even though the dribble was interrupted it has not ended and A1 may continue the dribble. In (c), the dribble ended when A1 caught the ball; and it ended in (d) when it was fumbled. Even though the dribble has ended in (c) and (d), A1 may recover the ball but may not dribble again. (9-5)

### 4.15.4 SITUATION E :

While A1 is dribbling in A's backcourt, the ball legally touches B1's leg, causing it to bounce away from A1. A1 quickly recovers the ball with two hands and then starts another dribble.

**RULING:** 
Legal. The touch by B1 ended the original dribble and A1 could then recover and dribble again. However, the touch by B1 did not end team control and the 10-second backcourt count continues. (9-5-2)
FIGHTING
4.18.2 SITUATION:
A1 dunks over B1 and then taunts B1. B1 retaliates and punches A1.

**RULING:** 
Both A1 and B1 are charged with a flagrant technical foul for fighting and are disqualified. A1's action is defined as fighting when the taunting caused B1 to retaliate by fighting. (10-4-6c, 10-4, 10-4-8)
INTENTIONAL FOUL

### 4.19.3 SITUATION A :

B1 is charged with an intentional foul on A1 who is in the act of shooting: (a) a successful two-point or three-point try; (b) an unsuccessful two-point try; or (c) an unsuccessful three-point try.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), A1 is awarded two free throws in addition to points awarded for a successful try. In (c), A1 is awarded three free throws. In all situations following the free throws, Team A is awarded a throw-in at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line.

### 4.19.3 SITUATION B :

A1 drives to the basket with B1 in pursuit. As A1 begins the act of shooting, B1 gets a hand on the ball from behind and the subsequent contact takes A1 forcefully to the floor and out of bounds.

**RULING:** 
An intentional foul shall be charged when the contact is judged to be excessive, even though the opponent is playing the ball. (4-11, 4-19-3d)

### 4.19.3 SITUATION C :

Team A leads by three points with four seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Team A is to throw-in from a spot out of bounds on the end line. Players begin jockeying for positions just after the official has handed the ball to A1.

<!-- Page 31: Page 31 -->

B1, while trying to deny a pass from A1 to A2: (a) grabs A2's jersey; or (b) pushes A2 from behind.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), it is an intentional personal foul designed to keep the clock from starting or to neutralize an opponent's obvious advantageous position.
4.19.3
SITUATION D:
Late in the fourth quarter Team B is trailing by six points. Team B's head coach begins to yell to his or her players to "foul, foul, foul!" B1 responds by (a) grabbing A1 from behind, or (b) reaching for the ball but illegally contacting A1 on the arm.

**RULING:** 
In (a), an intentional foul shall be ruled. In (b), a common foul shall be ruled as B1 was making a legitimate attempt to "play the ball."

**COMMENT:** 
Fouling near the end of a game is an acceptable coaching and playing strategy. Officials must determine if a foul is intentional by judging the fouling act itself, not whether or not the coach instructed a player to perform the act.
4.19.3
SITUATION E:
A1 is dribbling in the frontcourt. A3 and B4 are in the free-throw lane. (a) A3 throws B4 to the floor; (b) B4 throws A3 to the floor.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), intentional foul due to excessive contact while the ball is live. (4-19-3d)
4.19.3
SITUATION F:
After a rebound, A1, while holding the ball, pivots and A1's elbow contacts B1 above the shoulders. A1's elbow is violently and excessively swung at a speed in excess of the player’s torso.

**RULING:** 
If the contact is violent or excessive, a flagrant foul shall be called. (4-19-2, 4-19-4, 4-27)
4.19.3
SITUATION G:
Late in the fourth quarter, Team A leads by three points and Team B wishes to foul to stop the clock. B1 from behind (a) places two hands; (b) places and keeps one hand; or (c) is unable to keep a hand on the back of the dribbler A1 as they move into the frontcourt.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), even though B1 was unable to reach for the ball, they made a legitimate play on the dribbler and committed a common foul. In (c), this is incidental contact. Play should continue and the clock should continue to run.
TECHNICAL FOUL
4.19.5 SITUATION:
A1 is fouled by B1. A1 subsequently pushes B1.
RULING
:
If a foul is ruled on A1, it must be either an intentional or flagrant technical. If it is ruled flagrant, A1 must be disqualified. If A1's contact during a dead ball was neither intentional nor flagrant, it is incidental. (4-19-1 Note, 10-4-7)
PLAYER-CONTROL FOUL
4.19.6
SITUATION A:
B1 obtains a legal position in A1's path before A1 becomes airborne. A1 jumps and releases the ball on a try for goal. Before returning to the floor, airborne shooter A1 charges into B1. (a) Before the foul by A1, B2 commits basket interference; or (b) after the foul on A1, B2 slaps the ball on its downward flight.
RULING
:
In (a), both the violation and the foul are penalized. The basket interference by B2 causes the ball to become dead immediately. The violation is penalized by awarding the two points. The player-control foul on A1 is also charged. Team B is awarded the ball for a throw-in anywhere along the end line. A defensive-goaltending or basket-interference violation committed prior to

<!-- Page 32: Page 32 -->

a player-control foul does not contradict the general statement that when a player-control foul occurs that player cannot score. In the case of a defensive violation, it is the violation which results in awarding the score. In (b), the ball becomes dead and the try ends immediately when the player-control foul on A1 occurs. The action of B2 is ignored as goaltending cannot occur after the try has ended. The ball is awarded to Team B for a throw-in from a designated spot out of bounds closest to where the foul occurred. (4-12-1, 6-7-4, 6-7-9 Exception, 7-5-3b, 9-11)

### 4.19.6 SITUATION B :

Is it possible for airborne shooter A1 to commit a foul which would not be player control?
RULING
:
Yes. The airborne shooter could be charged with an intentional or flagrant personal foul or with a technical foul. (4-19-2, 4-19-3, 4-19-4)
TEAM-CONTROL FOUL

### 4.19.7 SITUATION A :

A1 is dribbling the ball in the frontcourt when A2 sets an illegal screen against B2. Team B is in the bonus.

**RULING:** 
No free throws are awarded as this is a team-control foul. Award the ball to Team B at a designated spot out of bounds closest to where the foul occurred. (4-12-2, 7-5-3b)

### 4.19.7 SITUATION B :

A1 is passing the ball to A2 in the team's frontcourt when B2 deflects the pass. As A2 and B2 are attempting to retrieve the loose ball, A2 illegally pushes B2 from behind and a foul is ruled. Team B is in the bonus.

**RULING:** 
No free throws are awarded as this is a team-control foul. Award the ball to Team B at a designated spot out of bounds closest to where the foul occurred. (4-12-2, 4-12-3b, 7-5-3b)

### 4.19.7 SITUATION C :

A1 ends the dribble in Team A's backcourt and passes the ball to A2: (a) while the ball is in the air; or (b) after A2 has control, A1 charges into B2.

**RULING:** 
The foul on A1 in both (a) and (b) is a team-control foul. Team B is awarded the ball in its frontcourt for a throw-in at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. (4-12-2, 4-12-4, 7-5-3a)

### 4.19.7 SITUATION D :

A1 has the ball for a throw-in in Team A's backcourt. The throw-in pass deflects off of A2. As A2 and B2 are attempting to retrieve the loose throw-in pass, A2 illegally pushes B2 from behind and the action is ruled a foul. Team B is in the bonus.

**RULING:** 
Team A is in control during this throw in, therefore a team-control foul has been committed. B2 is awarded a throw in at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. (4-12-2d, 7-5-3a)
DOUBLE FOULS

### 4.19.8 SITUATION A :

A1 and B1 foul one another at approximately the same time. The contact occurs during: (a) a live-ball situation; or (b) a dead-ball situation.
RULING
:
In (a), it is a double personal foul and in (b), it is a double technical foul. No free

<!-- Page 33: Page 33 -->

throws are awarded in (a) or (b) and play resumes at the point of interruption. (4-36)

### 4.19.8 SITUATION B :

While the ball is being dribbled near the division line, A1 and B1 are engaged in extremely rough play in the low post area and the covering official rules a double personal foul. After the whistle, A1 and B1 use profanity directed at each other and the covering official rules a double technical foul.

**RULING:** 
The double personal foul during the live ball results in no free throws. The dead-ball profanity results in a double technical foul, again with no free throws. A1 and B1 have each accumulated two fouls toward their five for disqualification. Play is resumed at the point of interruption. (4-36)

### 4.19.8 SITUATION C :

A1 drives for a try and jumps and releases the ball. Contact occurs between A1 and B1 after the release and before airborne shooter A1 returns one foot to the floor. One official rules a blocking foul on B1 and the other official rules a charging foul on A1. The try is (a) successful, or (b) not successful.

**RULING:** 
Even though airborne shooter A1 committed a charging foul, it is not a player-control foul because the two fouls result in a double personal foul. The double foul does not cause the ball to become dead on the try. In (a), the goal is scored; play is resumed at the point of interruption, which is a throw-in for Team B from anywhere along the end line. In (b), the point of interruption is a try in flight; therefore the alternating-possession procedure is used. (4-36)

### 4.19.8 SITUATION D :

A1 has control of the ball in Team A's frontcourt. Post players A5 and B5 are pushing each other in an attempt to gain a more advantageous position on the block while (a) A1 is dribbling the ball; (b) the ball is in the air on a pass from A1 to A2; or (c) the ball is in the air on an unsuccessful try for goal by A1. An official rules a double personal foul on A5 and B5.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), Team A had control of the ball when the double foul occurred, and thus play will be resumed at the point of interruption. Team A will have a designated spot throw-in at one of the four designated spots nearest the location where the ball was located relative to the three-point line when the double foul occurred. In (c), no team has control while a try for goal is in flight, and since the try was unsuccessful, there is no obvious point of interruption. If Team A is awarded possession based on alternating-possession, play will resume with a throw-in at one of the four designated spots nearest where the ball was located relative to the three-point line when the double foul occurred. (4-36)

### 4.19.8 SITUATION E :

A1 releases the ball on a throw-in, and before it is legally touched, A2 and B2 commit fouls against each other.

**RULING:** 
When a double foul occurs, play is resumed at the point of interruption. Since Team A's throw-in had not ended, the point of interruption would be a throw-in by Team A. (4-36-2b, 10 Penalty 1c)
FALSE DOUBLE FOUL

### 4.19.9 SITUATION A :

A1 leaps high and is fouled by B1 as A1 taps the ball which subsequently goes through A's basket. A1 fouls B2 in returning to the floor.
RULING
:
This is a false double foul. The foul by B1 does not cause the ball to become

<!-- Page 34: Page 34 -->

dead. However, the player-control foul by A1 does cause the ball to become dead and also dictates that no goal can be scored. Since the goal is not scored, A1 is awarded two free throws for the foul by B1. No players are allowed in the free-throw lane spaces as Team B will be awarded the ball following the last free throw. If the last throw is successful, the throw-in is from anywhere along the end line. If the last throw is unsuccessful, the throw-in is from one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. (4-1, 4-11, 4-41-1, 6-7-4, 6-7-7 Exception c, 7-5-3b)

### 4.19.9 SITUATION B :

B1 holds A1, whose team is in the bonus. A1 is successful in both free-throw attempts. While B1 is making the throw-in from behind the end line, A1 pushes B2 in Team B's backcourt. Team B (a) has five or more fouls for the quarter; (b) has less than five team fouls in the quarter.
RULING
:
In (a), B2 is awarded two free throws and the ball remains in play if the second is unsuccessful. If the last free-throw attempt by B2 is successful, Team A shall put the ball in play from out of bounds anywhere along the end line by B's basket. In (b), Team B is awarded the ball for a throw-in from one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. Penalties are administered in the order in which the fouls occurred. (7-5-3b)

### 4.19.9 SITUATION C :

A1 has a breakaway lay-up. B1 commits a hard foul against A1 from behind and it is ruled an intentional foul. The Team A head coach protests, feeling the foul should have been a flagrant foul and is assessed a technical foul.

**RULING:** 
Award A1's goal if successful. A1 shall receive two free throws with the free-throw lane spaces cleared. Any Team B player is then awarded two free throws for the technical foul. Team B will be awarded the ball for a throw-in at the division line opposite the scorers table.
SIMULTANEOUS FOUL
4.19.10 SITUATION:
B1 fouls dribbling A1 near the division line in Team A's frontcourt. At approximately the same time, A2 fouls B2 in the free-throw lane near Team A's basket.
RULING
:
This is a simultaneous personal foul. B1 and A2 are charged with personal fouls. The ball shall be put back in play at the point of interruption. Team A is awarded a throw-in at the 28-foot mark on the sideline nearest to where the ball was located when the fouls occurred. (4-36, 7-5-3a)
MULTIPLE FOUL
4.19.11 SITUATION:
B1 and B2 foul A1 at the same time while A1 is: (a) driving down the free-throw lane; (b) in the act of shooting a successful or unsuccessful two-point try; (c) a successful three-point try; or (d) an unsuccessful three-point try.
RULING
:
One free throw for each foul in (a), (b) and (c) and two free throws for each in (d). (10 Penalty 6)
FALSE MULTIPLE FOUL
4.19.12 SITUATION:
B1 fouls airborne A1 who is in the act of shooting. Before

<!-- Page 35: Page 35 -->

airborne shooter A1 returns one foot to the floor, the player is fouled by B2 who has moved into A1's landing area. The ball: (a) does; or (b) does not, enter the basket.
RULING
:
This is a false multiple foul and each foul carries its own penalty. In (a), the goal is counted and A1 is awarded one free throw for each foul. In (b), A1 is awarded two free throws for each foul. (10 Penalty 6, 10 Penalty 7)
FIGHT ADDS TO TEAM FOULS
4.19.13 SITUATION:
Three substitutes of Team B leave the bench and come onto the court during a fight.
RULING
:
The three substitutes are each charged with a flagrant technical foul and are disqualified. The Team B head coach is also charged indirectly with a technical foul resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. Team A is awarded two free throws plus the ball for a throw-in for this multiple infraction. Team B is charged with three fouls for reaching the bonus. In addition, the proper fouls are charged and penalties are assessed for the players who were fighting. (10-5-5 Penalty)
DEAD-BALL LIVE-BALL FOULS
4.19.14 SITUATION:
What type of foul is committed when: (a) during a dead-ball period A1 taunts B1; (b) B1 crosses the end line and fouls thrower A1; (c) immediately after the ball passes through the basket, airborne shooter A1 fouls B1; or (d) B1 reaches through the end-line boundary and slaps the ball from the hands of thrower A1.
RULING
:
It is an unsporting technical foul in (a) and an intentional personal foul in (b). There is no score in (c), as A1 has committed a player-control foul. The foul in (d) is a technical foul charged to B1.
GUARDING POSITION
4.23.1 SITUATION:
(a) A1 is dribbling the ball; (b) A1 secures a rebound; or (c) A1 has returned to the floor after releasing a try for goal. In all cases, A1 trips over B1 who is lying on the floor, causing A1 to fall to the floor and/or lose control of the ball.

**RULING:** 
In (a), (b) and (c), blocking foul on B1.

**COMMENT:** 
Lying on the playing court is not considered a legal guarding position. (4-23-2)
4.23.3
SITUATION A:
B1 has obtained a legal guarding position on A1 and moves to maintain it. A1 moves laterally and contacts defender B1 but does not get A1's head and shoulders past the torso of B1. Contact occurs on the side of B1's torso.
RULING
:
Player-control foul by A1. (4-7-2)
4.23.3
SITUATION B:
A1 is dribbling near the sideline when B1 obtains legal guarding position. B1 stays in the path of A1 but in doing so has (a) one foot touching the sideline or (b) one foot in the air over the out-of-bounds area when A1 contacts B1 in the torso.

**RULING:** 
In (a), a blocking foul is ruled on B1 because a player may not be out of bounds and obtain or maintain legal guarding position. In (b), a player-control foul is ruled on A1 because B2 had obtained and maintained legal guarding position. (4-23-2, 4-23-3a)

<!-- Page 36: Page 36 -->

HELD BALL
4.25.1 SITUATION:
Must each opponent have two hands on the ball to cause a held ball?

**RULING:** 
No. A held ball could occur if one or both opponents have one or both hands on the ball. When officials judge that the ball cannot be controlled by a player without causing undue roughness, a held ball should be called. This may (or may not) occur if opponents have one or both of their hands on the ball.
4.25.2 SITUATION:
A1 jumps to try for goal or to pass the ball. B1 leaps or reaches and is able to put B1's hands on the ball and keep A1 from releasing it. A1: (a) returns to the floor with the ball; or (b) is unable to control the ball and it drops to the floor.
RULING
:
A held ball results immediately in (a) and (b) when airborne A1 is prevented from releasing the ball to pass or try for goal.
KICKING THE BALL

### 4.29 SITUATION a :

During A1's attempt to pass to A2 in Team A's backcourt, B1 (a) intentionally uses a thigh to deflect the pass; (b) intentionally kicks the ball; or (c) has the ball accidentally hit B1's lower leg.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), there is a kicking violation and Team A will receive the ball out of bounds based on the location of the violation relative to the three-point line. In (c), the ball remains live and there is no violation. (7-5-3b, 9-4)

### 4.29 SITUATION B :

A1 has the ball for a throw-in. A1 rolls the ball to A2 who stops the ball by putting a foot on top of it, then bends over and picks up the ball.

**RULING:** 
Kicking violation on A2 for intentionally striking the ball with a foot. (9-4)
PIVOT
4.33 SITUATION:
A1 catches the ball while both feet are off the floor, alights on one foot, jumps off that foot and comes to a stop with both feet simultaneously hitting the floor. A1 then lifts one foot and throws for a goal or passes.
RULING
:
Legal. A1 may lift either foot in passing or trying for a goal in this SITUATION. However, A1 may not pivot; that is, A1 may not lift one foot from the floor and then step (touch the floor) with that foot before the ball has left the hand(s). By rule, a pivot means a player "steps once or more than once with the same foot…" [4-44-2a(3), 4-44-4a]
PLAYERS/BENCH PERSONNEL/SUBSTITUTES
4.34.1 SITUATION:
Team A requests a time-out; at the conclusion of the time-out as the teams are returning to the court, A1 curses at the game officials.

**RULING:** 
A1 is assessed a technical foul. The foul will count as one of A1's fouls toward disqualification and toward the team foul count.
An indirect technical foul is also charged to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges as A1 is considered bench personnel in this situation.

**COMMENT:** 
Once the official has instructed the timer to start the time-out, all players become bench personnel. They remain bench personnel until the ball becomes live following the timeout.

**COMMENT:** 
During a time-out, A1 is considered a player and not bench personnel.
4.34.2 SITUATION:
The third quarter ends; as the teams are heading to their respective benches, team members A1 and B1 verbally taunt one another.

**RULING:** 
Double technical foul charged to A1 and B1. During the intermission between quarters, all team members are bench personnel for the purpose of penalizing unsporting behavior. Both head coaches are indirectly charged with technical

<!-- Page 37: Page 37 -->

fouls and lose their coaching box privileges. Play will resume at the point of interruption, which is an alternating-possession arrow throw-in, to begin the fourth quarter. (10-5-1d, 10-5-1d Penalty)
4.34.3 SITUATION:
Substitute A6 reports to the scorer to replace player A1 and awaits entry to the game. The U2 beckons A6 onto the court, and (a) A6 enters the court to participate; (b) A6 enters the court and commits an unsporting, non-contact foul; or (c) A1 swears at the official while heading to the bench.
RULING
:
A6 became a player upon being beckoned by the official and entering the court. Legal in (a). In (b) A6, now a player, is penalized with a technical foul which is added to the team foul total. In (c) A1, now bench personnel, is penalized with a technical foul, which is added to the team foul total and also charged as an indirect technical foul to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges.
PLAYER LOCATION/Status
4.35.1 SITUATION:
Thrower A1 inbounds the ball to A2. A2 immediately throws the ball back to A1. When A1 touches the pass, A1 has: (a) both feet touching inbounds; (b) one foot touching inbounds and one out of bounds; or (c) one foot touching inbounds and the other not touching the floor.
RULING
:
The ball remains live in (a) and (c), but A1 has caused the ball to be out of bounds in (b). (4-4-4, 4-35-3)
REBOUNDING CONTACT
4.37.1 SITUATION:
While A1's try or tap for field goal is in flight, A2 and B2 legally obtain potential rebounding positions. B2's back is positioned towards A2 and is directly between A2 and the basket. As the unsuccessful try or tap for field goal rebounds from the ring: (a) B2 moves backward and pushes/displaces A2 from a legal position; or (b) A2 "beats" B2, getting A2's head and shoulders past the front of B2's torso. B2 then moves laterally and pushes/displaces A2.
RULING
:
A foul on B2 in both (a) and (b). (4-7-1, 4-19-1)
SCREEN

### 4.40.2 SITUATION A :

A1 sets a stationary screen with one foot on or outside a boundary line. B1 makes contact with A1 in the torso.

**RULING:** 
A blocking foul is ruled on A1 because a player may not be out-of-bounds while setting a legal screen.

### 4.40.2 SITUATION B :

A1 sets a stationary screen with their feet wider than shoulder width. B1 makes contact in the middle of A1's torso.

**RULING:** 
No foul since the contact was made in the A1's torso and the wider stance did not create an advantage.
ACT OF SHOOTING, TRY
4.41.1 SITUATION:
B1 commits a common foul by holding A1 during a field-goal try, but after A1 has completed the act of shooting. The foul is Team B's fourth foul of the quarter. The attempt is: (a) successful; or (b) unsuccessful.
RULING
:
A personal foul is charged to B1 in both (a) and (b), but no free throw is awarded to

<!-- Page 38: Page 38 -->

A1 in either case. In both (a) and (b), the ball is awarded to Team A at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. The points are awarded for a successful try. (7-5-3a)
4.41.2 SITUATION:
A1 becomes confused and throws the ball at the wrong basket. A1 is fouled by B1 and the ball goes into the basket. Is this a successful basket? If A1 missed, would A1 be awarded two free throws for the foul by B1?
RULING
:
No goal. The ball became dead when the foul occurred. When a player throws at the opponent's basket, it is not a try. If the team is in the bonus when B1 fouled A1, A1 is given two free throws at Team A's basket. If Team A was not in the bonus, then the ball is awarded to Team A for a throw-in at one of the four designated out-of-bounds spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. (7-5-3b)

### 4.41.4 SITUATION A :

While the ball is in flight on a try for goal by A1: (a) B1 touches the ball and then time expires; or (b) time expires and then B1 touches the ball. The ball continues in flight and enters Team A's basket.
RULING
:
The goal is scored in both (a) and (b), as B1's touching did not cause the try to end. However, in both (a) and (b), if B1's touching is either goaltending or basket interference, the ball becomes dead and two points will be awarded. (6-7 Exception a, 9-11, 9-12)

### 4.41.4 SITUATION B :

A1's three-point try is short and below ring level when it hits the shoulder of: (a) A2; or (b) B1 and rebounds to the backboard and through the basket.
RULING
:
The three-point try ended when it was obviously short and below the ring. However, since a live ball went through the basket, two points are scored in both (a) and (b). (5-1)
THROW-IN
4.42.3 SITUATION:
Following a goal by A1 the ball is: (a) inadvertently deflected under the bleachers; (b) bouncing on the court just outside the end line as B1 goes toward the ball; or (c) lying on the court just outside the end line as B1 delays the inbound by getting instruction from a coach. When does the throw-in begin and the ball become live?

**RULING:** 
In (a), the official shall signal for the clock to be stopped. The throw-in begins and the ball becomes live when it is at the disposal of Team B. In (b) and (c), the throw-in begins and the ball becomes live when it is available to B1 and the official begins the throw-in count. In (c), the throw-in count begins when the official determines B1 has had ample time to secure the ball; it need not be in B1's control. (4-4-7d)
4.42.5 SITUATION:
Team A is awarded an alternating-possession throw-in in Team A's backcourt. A1's throw-in pass is illegally kicked by B2.

**RULING:** 
As a result of B2's kicking violation, Team A is awarded a new throw-in at one of the four designated spots based on where the kicking violation (illegal touching) occurred in relation to the three-point line. Since the alternating-possession throw-in had not been contacted legally, the throw-in has not ended and therefore, the arrow remains with Team A for the next alternating-possession throw-in.

**COMMENT:** 
The kicking violation ends the alternating-possession throw-in and as a result, a non-alternating-possession throw-in is administered. When the ball is legally

<!-- Page 39: Page 39 -->

touched on the subsequent throw-in following the kicking violation, the arrow shall not be changed and shall remain with Team A. (6-4-5)
4.42.6 SITUATION:
Following a personal foul by B3, the official indicates to Team A that they shall inbound the ball from the designated spot on the end line, 3 feet outside of the lane line closest to the team bench. In (a), A1 jumps in the air, over the designated spot, and passes the ball inbounds; (b) A1 has one foot within the designated-spot area but lifts it from the floor as the inbounds pass is made; or (c) A1 moves directly backwards from the designated spot by 6 feet and passes the ball inbounds.

**RULING:** 
Legal in (a), (b) and (c). As long as the thrower maintains any portion of the body on or above the 3-foot designated-spot area while making the throw-in, the throw-in shall be legal.
TRAVELING – OR NOT

### 4.44 SITUATION A :

A1 attempts to catch the ball while running rapidly. A1 muffs the ball, but succeeds in securing it before it strikes the floor. A1 then begins a dribble, taking several steps between the time the ball was first touched until it was caught.

**RULING:** 
There has been no violation provided A1, after catching the ball, released the ball to start the dribble before the pivot foot was lifted from the floor. (4-15)

### 4.44 SITUATION B :

A1 attempts a try after ending the dribble. The try does not touch the backboard, the ring or any other player. A1 runs and is able to catch the ball before it strikes the floor. Is this traveling?

**RULING:** 
No. When A1 recovered A1's own try, A1 could either dribble, pass or try again. There was no team control after the ball was released on a try. (4-12, 4-41)

### 4.44.2 SITUATION A :

Dribbler A1 catches the ball with the right foot touching the floor and then jumps off that foot and alights on both feet simultaneously: (a) with feet parallel; or (b) with one foot in advance.

**RULING:** 
The position of the feet has no significance, but they must come to the floor simultaneously. In both (a) and (b), it is a violation if A1 pivots on either foot.

### 4.44.2 SITUATION B :

Airborne A1 and A2 jointly grab the rebound and each alights simultaneously on both feet. A1 and A2 each move one foot in attempting to wrestle the ball from each other before realizing they are teammates. A1 lets go and A2 dribbles away.

**RULING:** 
Legal. There has been no violation as neither A1 or A2 moved a pivot foot while they were in joint control.

### 4.44.3 SITUATION A :

A1 jumps to try for goal. B1 also jumps and: (a) slaps the ball out of A1's hands; (b) touches the ball but does not prevent A1 from releasing the ball; (c) touches the ball and A1 returns to the floor holding the ball; or (d) touches the ball and A1 drops it to the floor and touches it first after it bounces.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), the ball remains live. In (c), a traveling violation. In (d), a violation for starting a dribble with the pivot foot off the floor. Since the touching did not prevent the pass or try in (b), (c) and (d), the ball remains live and subsequent action is covered by rules which apply to the situation.

<!-- Page 40: Page 40 -->


### 4.44.3 SITUATION B :

A1 receives a pass and establishes the right foot as the pivot. While faking a pass or try, A1 lifts the pivot foot and stands on the left foot alone while undecided as to what to do. Has A1 traveled?
RULING
:
No. Traveling would occur only if A1 begins a dribble or returns the pivot foot to the floor. While in this position A1 may pass, try for goal or request a time-out.

### 4.44.3 SITUATION C :

(a) A1 tosses the ball from one hand to the other while keeping A1's pivot foot in contact with the floor; or (b) A1 throws the ball over the head of B1 and then takes several steps before catching it.

**RULING:** 
Legal in (a), but a traveling violation in (b). In (b), since the ball did not touch the floor, the tossing and subsequent catch is illegal. (9-4)

### 4.44.5 SITUATION A :

Is it traveling if A1 falls to the floor: (a) while holding the ball; or (b) after being airborne to catch a pass or control a rebound?
RULING
:
Yes in both (a) and (b).

### 4.44.5 SITUATION B :

A1 dives for a loose ball and slides after gaining control. A1 is in a position either on the back or stomach. What can A1 do without violating?
RULING
:
A1 may pass, shoot, start a dribble or request a time-out. Once A1 has the ball and is no longer sliding, the player may not roll over. If flat on the back, A1 may sit up without violating. Any attempt to get to the feet is traveling unless A1 is dribbling. It is also traveling if A1 puts the ball on the floor, then rises and is first to touch the ball. (4-44-5b)

### 4.44.5 SITUATION C :

A1 secures control of the ball with one knee in contact with the floor. May A1 assume a standing position without committing a traveling violation?
RULING
:
It depends on what A1 does. If A1 attempts to stand up while holding the ball, a traveling violation occurs. However, if A1 starts a dribble and then rises, no violation has occurred. Also, A1 could pass, try for goal or request a time-out from that position.
WARNING FOR MISCONDUCT
4.48 SITUATION:
Following a goal by A1, the head coach of B confronts the center official with language that is considered to be (a) profane and violent; (b) argumentative; (c) questioning.

**RULING:** 
(a) The official rules a technical foul on the head coach because of profane and violent language. (b) The official issues a warning to the head coach which is recorded in the scorebook. (c) The official may issue a warning to the coach. (10-5-1a)
NOTE:
The head coach/team bench should receive only one warning for unsporting behavior. All other unsporting behaviors should be ruled such and a technical foul assessed.

<!-- Page 41: Page 41 -->


# Rule 5 – Scoring and Timing Regulations

FROM FLOOR TO BASKET

### 5.1.1 SITUATION A :

A pass, a tap or a try for field goal by A1 comes down several feet in front of the basket in the middle of the third quarter. The ball strikes the floor without touching any player and bounces into the basket.

**RULING:** 
Two points are scored. The tap or the try for field goal by A1 ends when the ball touches the floor but a field goal can be scored when it is not the result of a try or tap for field goal. Credit the two points to A1. (4-41-2, 4-41-4, 4-41-5)

### 5.1.1 SITUATION B :

A pass, a tap or a try for field goal by A1 is in flight when the horn sounds indicating the expiration of time in the third quarter. The ball subsequently comes down several feet in front of the basket, strikes the floor without touching any player and bounces into the basket.

**RULING:** 
When deemed a pass and not a try for field goal, the ball becomes dead immediately when the horn sounds. However, a try or tap for field goal by A1 towards A's basket does not become dead until the try or tap ends, which it does when it touches the floor. Therefore, no points are scored. (4-41-2, 4-41-4, 4-41-5)
three-point TRY

### 5.2.1 SITUATION A :

A1 attempts a three-point goal. B1 slaps the ball: (a) while it is in downward flight outside the cylinder, but above the ring level; or (b) while it is in the cylinder after bouncing off the ring.

**RULING:** 
It is defensive goaltending in (a) and defensive basket interference in (b). Three points are awarded in both cases as a result of the violation. (9-11, 9-12)

### 5.2.1 SITUATION B :

With 2:45 left in the second quarter, B1 has the ball on the left wing in Team B's frontcourt, standing behind the three-point line. B5 makes a backdoor cut toward the basket. B1 passes the ball toward the ring and B5 leaps for the potential "alley-oop" dunk. The ball, however, enters and passes through the goal directly from B1's pass and is not touched by B5.
RULING
:
Score three points for Team B. A ball that is thrown into a team's own goal from behind the three-point line scores three points, regardless of whether the thrown ball was an actual try for goal
as long as the ball was above the ring and/or had a chance to go in
.

### 5.2.1 SITUATION C :

A1 throws the ball from behind the three-point line. The ball is above the level of the ring and/or has a chance to go in. The ball is legally touched by (a) B1 who is in the three-point area; (b) B1 who is in the two-point area; (c) A2 who is in the three-point area; or (d) A2 who is in the two-point area. The ball continues in flight and goes through A's basket.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), three points are scored since the legal touching was by the defense and the ball was thrown by A1 from behind the three-point line. In (c), score three points since the legal touch by a teammate occurred behind the three-point line, the ball was

<!-- Page 42: Page 42 -->

above the ring and/or had a chance to go in. In (d), score two points since the legal touch by a teammate occurred in the two-point area.

**COMMENT:** 
In all situations, when there is no possibility of the ball entering the basket from above and the touching/deflection causes the goal to be successful, it shall be a two-point goal.
NOT A TRY or tap for FIELD goal

### 5.2.1 SITUATION D :

Following the free throws for a technical foul, A1 makes a throw-in from out of bounds at the division line opposite the table. The throw-in pass is deflected at A's free-throw line by: (a) A2; or (b) B1 and it then goes directly through A's basket.

**RULING:** 
Score two points for Team A in both (a) and (b). The throw-in ended when the ball was touched by an inbounds player and the live ball subsequently passed through the basket. The fact it was not a try or tap for field goal does not affect the scoring of two points. (4-41-4)
JUMPERS FACING WRONG DIRECTION

### 5.2.1 SITUATION E :

During the pregame practice period, the visiting team properly uses the east goal and the home team the west goal. The officials, by mistake, allow the jumpers to face the wrong direction to start the game. A1 controls the tap by tapping the ball back to A2. A2, realizing that the team had warmed up at the basket behind A1, dribbles to that basket and scores an uncontested basket.

**RULING:** 
Score the basket for Team A. The officials should stop the game and emphasize to both teams the proper direction. Allowing A1 and B1 to face the wrong direction is an official’s error and not a correctable error, as in Rule 2-10. (4-5-4)

### 5.2.1 SITUATION F :

During the pregame practice period, the visiting team properly uses the east goal and the home team the west goal. The officials, by mistake, allow the jumpers to face the wrong direction to start the game. Several baskets are scored before it is recognized that both teams are throwing the ball into the opponent's basket.
RULING
:
All points scored count as if the teams had gone the right direction and scored in their own basket. Once the mistake is recognized, play shall continue with each team attempting to score in its own basket. (4-5-4)
CREDITING POINTS
5.2.3 SITUATION:
A1 completes the throw-in to A2 to begin the second half. A2 is confused and dribbles toward the basket Team A used during the first half and dunks the ball into the basket of Team B.
RULING
:
Legal goal. Two points are awarded to Team B. The ball is bounced/handed to a player of Team A out of bounds at the basket of Team B. Team A may put the ball in play from anywhere along the end line as after any score by B (earned or awarded). (5-2-1, 7-5-7)
THREE-TENTHS OF A SECOND OR LESS ON CLOCK

### 5.2.5 SITUATION A :

The game clock shows three-tenths of a second or less in the third quarter when A2: (a) taps the ball; or (b) grabs A1's missed free throw or throw-in pass and quickly shoots. In both cases the ball leaves A2's hand(s)

<!-- Page 43: Page 43 -->

before the end-of-period signal and goes through A's basket.
RULING
:
Count the goal in (a), but not in (b).

### 5.2.5 SITUATION B :

With three-tenths of a second or less left in the first half, Team B has been charged with only four team fouls. A1 is at the free throw line for one free throw. A1's shot hits the ring and bounds off. A2 legally taps the ball toward the basket and is fouled by B3. The ball had left A2's hand and the foul occurred before the end-of-period signal. The tap is unsuccessful.
RULING
:
B3's foul is considered in the "act of tapping" and will result in two free throws for A2. The free-throw lane spaces will be cleared and the period ends after A2's free throw attempts. (4-41-1, 4-41-5, 4-41-6, 4-41-7)

### 5.2.5 SITUATION C :

With three-tenths of a second or less left in a tied game, each team is in the bonus. Team A has a throw-in on the end line near its basket. A1 throws the ball to A5 on the near block who catches the ball and quickly shoots. A5 is fouled by B3 just prior to the end-of-period signal. The ball goes through A's basket.

**RULING:** 
Since A5 may not catch the ball and attempt a try with three-tenths of a second or less, A5 cannot score a goal and is not considered in the act of shooting. However, B3's foul cannot be ignored and is considered a common foul. A5 is awarded bonus free throws with the free-throw lane spaces cleared. A5's free throw attempts will determine if the game is over or if an overtime period is necessary. (4-41-6)
FORFEITURE

### 5.4.1 SITUATION A :

A1 commits A1's fifth personal foul. Both the head coach and player are properly notified. Team A has substitutes available but the head coach from Team A does not send a substitute to the table within the 15-second time limit. The Team A head coach is assessed a technical foul. The head coach still does not send a substitute to the table.

**RULING:** 
The official should forfeit the contest to the opposing team for the head coach delaying the contest and attempting to make a travesty of the game.

**COMMENT:** 
The referee may forfeit a game if any player, team member, bench personnel or coach fails to comply with any technical foul penalty.

### 5.4.1 SITUATION B :

The covering official rules a double foul on the post player and opponent after both push and shove each other. It is the fifth foul on each player. Some spectators in the crowd react vocally in a negative manner while others throw paper cups, etc., on the floor. The entire crowd seems to be in a hostile mood. What should the officials do?
RULING
:
The officials must ask game management or home management to control the spectators. The officials have authority to charge a technical foul(s) if it can be determined which team's spectators are involved. However, much discretion is necessary in this case and the officials must be aware that a technical foul(s) on spectators usually leads to even more problems.
COMMENT
:
The game should not be forfeited to either team because of the action of spectators. If game or home management cannot restore order by removal or other means, the officials are authorized to suspend play. The

<!-- Page 44: Page 44 -->

game would then be continued from the point of interruption, unless the teams agree to terminate the game with the existing score, or there are conference, league or state association rules which apply. (2-8-1 NOTE)

### 5.4.1 SITUATION C :

Team A's head coach is ejected for receiving a second direct technical foul. Team A has no other coach or authorized school personnel available to continue coaching the team.

**RULING:** 
Unless state association rules determine otherwise, the game shall be declared a forfeit.

**COMMENT:** 
When a coach is ejected and no authorized school personnel are present to assume responsibility for the team, the game is forfeited. (5-4-1b)
ENDING A QUARTER OR EXTRA PERIOD
5.6 SITUATION:
A1 is fouled in the act of shooting by B1 in the fourth quarter. A1's try or tap for field goal is successful to make the score with Team A leading 62-58. When the foul occurs, the clock is stopped with 0:00 showing, but no end-of-quarter signal (horn or light) has indicated.
RULING
:
A1 will attempt the free throw with free-throw lane spaces occupied as required. The fourth quarter time has not expired until the quarter-ending signal.

### 5.6.2 SITUATION A :

While the ball is in flight during a try by A1, time for the second quarter expires after which B1 touches the attempt on its upward flight toward the basket, however, the ball subsequently goes through the basket.
RULING
:
The touching does not end the try. The goal is scored. (4-41-4, 5-6-2 Exception 1)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION B :

Time for the first quarter expires while the ball is in flight during a field-goal try by A1. B1 intentionally fouls A2 before the field-goal attempt has ended. After the ball has become dead following the last free throw by A2, A3 flagrantly fouls B1.
RULING
:
A3 is disqualified for a flagrant technical foul. Because the foul by A3 was committed after the first quarter had ended. The second quarter will begin with the free-throw attempts by any Team B player. Team B is then awarded the ball at the division line opposite the table for a throw-in. This throw-in does not affect the possession arrow. (10-4-7, 10-4 PENALTY)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION C :

The ball is in flight during a try for field goal by A1 when time for the fourth quarter or for any extra period expires. The try is successful to make the score: (a) A-60, B-60; or (b) A-61, B-60. Clearly after the ball becomes dead, A2 contacts B1.
RULING
:
A technical foul is charged if contact during a dead ball is intentional or flagrant. If flagrant, it results in disqualification of the player in addition to the free throws. In (a), an extra period is played and this extra period is started by administering the penalty for the technical foul. If this occurrence is after an extra period, the procedure is the same as after the fourth quarter. The next extra period starts with the penalty for the technical foul. In (b), the free throws are treated the same as if they were part of the preceding quarter or extra period. If only one free throw is successful, an extra period is played and the overtime period is started with a jump. If neither or if both free throws are successful, the game is ended. (5-6-2 Exception 3, 5-6-2 Exception 4, 7-5-6a, 10-4-7)

<!-- Page 45: Page 45 -->


### 5.6.2 SITUATION D :

Team A trails 60-59 with just a few seconds remaining in the fourth quarter of play. A1 is fouled in the act of shooting by B1 but time expires before the ball is in flight. A1 is awarded two free throws. The coach of Team B is charged with a technical foul before A1's attempts. A1 makes: (a) neither throw; (b) one throw; or (c) both throws. When does Team A shoot the free throws resulting from the technical foul?

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), the two free throws for the technical foul are attempted as part of the fourth quarter as the foul occurred before the fourth quarter had ended. In (a), the two free throws for the technical foul will determine if an extra period is necessary. In (b), the one successful free throw ties the game and if either free throw for the technical foul is successful, no extra period is required. In (c), the two successful free throws dictate there will be no extra period. The free throws for the technical foul are not administered as the outcome of the game has been determined. A quarter or extra period does not end until all free throws which could affect the outcome of the game have been attempted and related activity has been completed. (4-41-1, 5-6-2 Exception 3, ­6-7-7)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION E :

A1 has been awarded two free throws after time has expired in the fourth quarter. Team B leads 62-60 and A1 misses the first free throw.
RULING
:
The second free throw will not be attempted. (5-6-2 Exception 3)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION F :

Following the end-of-game signal which has Team A leading 62-60, the coach of Team A sprints after the game officials and shouts profanity at the official who has just left the playing court outside the end line.
RULING
:
The referee shall charge the coach with a flagrant technical foul and the results of the two free throws will determine whether an extra period will be necessary. The jurisdiction of the officials had not ended as the official was still within the visual confines of the playing area. (2-2-4)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION G :

The score is tied when A1 is fouled in the act of shooting and the try is unsuccessful. Playing time for the fourth quarter expires while the ball is in flight. No players are allowed along the free-throw lane spaces. A1's first free-throw attempt is successful. Immediately following the made free throw the occupants of the Team A bench rush onto the court and a mini celebration takes place.

**RULING:** 
The second free throw is not required. No penalty unless the celebration or any act is unsporting and a foul is charged to Team A before the final score has been approved. (5-6-2 Exception 3)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION H :

Team A is leading 61-60. B1 fouls A1 in the act of shooting as time expires. As the officials approach the scorer's table, the Team A coach rushes the floor and begins screaming obscenities at the officials.
RULING
:
A flagrant technical foul is assessed to the Team A coach. The foul at the expiration of time is no longer ignored. The flagrant technical foul on the Team A coach created a false double foul situation, which may affect the outcome of the game. The penalties are administered in the order in which they occurred. With the free-throw lane spaces cleared, A1 shoots two free throws for being fouled in the act of shooting. If both are successful, the game is over. If one or both are missed, an eligible

<!-- Page 46: Page 46 -->

player from Team B shoots the two technical foul free throws. The free throws will determine the outcome of the game or an extra period will be played.
COMMENT
:
Jurisdiction of the officials is terminated when all officials leave the visual confines of the playing area. While the preferred action would be for all officials to immediately leave the playing area, such an observable action by the coach should be penalized as unsporting or flagrant. (4-19-9, 5-6-2 Exception 3, 10-5-1c)

### 5.6.2 SITUATION I :

During the pregame warm-up, the officials observe that the facility has functioning LED lights on each backboard. A1 begins the act of shooting just prior to the expiration of time in the first quarter. The covering official observes the attempt in A1's hands when the LED light is activated, but the ball appears to be out of the hands when the horn is sounded. The ball goes in the basket.

**RULING:** 
No goal; the quarter expired prior to the release of the try.

**COMMENT:** 
Red/LED lights provide a visual reference for officials to determine when a period has ended. The red/LED lights and the horn are expected to be synchronized, but since light travels faster than sound, it may appear that one follows the other. The red/LED lights give a more precise indication that a period has expired. (1-14, 6-7-6)
OVERTIME – OR NOT
5.7.1 SITUATION:
The score is B-62, A-60 when A1 is fouled with no time on the clock in the fourth quarter. The horn sounds immediately after the foul is called. Team A is not in the bonus but erroneously A1 is awarded a bonus and makes both free throws to tie the score. Team B controls the jump to start the overtime and B1 scores to make it 64 to 62. Before the ball becomes live on the subsequent throw-in, the scorer alerts the officials regarding a correctable-error situation.
RULING
:
The error is corrected by canceling the two erroneous free throws. However, once the overtime started with the ball becoming live, the extra period cannot be canceled even though the points were. The score is B-64, A-60 and the overtime continues with the throw-in by Team A. (2-10-1b, 2-11-11, 5-7-4)
LENGTH OF EXTRA PERIOD INCORRECT
5.7.3 SITUATION:
Following a violation in the first extra period, the timer beckons the referee to the table. The timer informs the referee that by mistake the period started with: (a) more; or (b) less than four minutes on the clock.
RULING
:
In (a), if the mistake is discovered before the clock reaches four minutes, the clock shall be set at four minutes and play resumes. If discovered after reaching four minutes, no correction is allowed. In (b), the appropriate amount of time shall be added to reflect a four-minute period. (2-5-5)
OVERTIME CONTINUES
5.7.4 SITUATION:
The score is tied at the end of regulation time. During the overtime period, the official scorer informs the referee that Team A had an additional point in the fourth quarter that was not counted. In (a), the referee reviews the scorebook and recognizes where a point was not properly credited to Team A;

<!-- Page 47: Page 47 -->

or (b) the referee does not have definite knowledge that a point was not credited to Team A.
RULING
:
In (a), the referee adds a point to Team A's score. In (b), the referee does not add a point to Team A's score. In either case, the referee continues the overtime period to completion. (2-11-11)
time-out requests
5.8.3
SITUATION A:
A1 fouls B1. The official who made the RULING moves toward the reporting area. A2 immediately signals the free official for a time-out. Momentarily thereafter, the scorer notifies the RULING official that A1 has fouled out.

**RULING:** 
A1 must be replaced before the time-out is granted.

**COMMENT:** 
The first responsibility the RULING official has is to report the foul to the scorer. Officials should not be hasty in granting an immediate time-out after the game has reached a point that players may begin to foul out. Rather, they should take a second or two after reporting the foul to see if the scorer may report a disqualification. (2-8-4)
5.8.3
SITUATION B:
Following a time-out, both teams are at the sideline with respective coaches after all signals have been given prior to a throw-in by Team A. Team A or Team B requests a time-out: (a) before; or (b) after, the official places the ball on the floor at the throw-in spot.
RULING
:
In (a), either team may be granted a time-out. In (b), Team A may, but Team B may not be granted a time-out after the ball is at A's disposal.
5.8.3
SITUATION C:
A1 fouls B2. The scorer notifies the nearest official that this is A1's fifth foul. The official notifies the coach of Team A of the disqualification. The official then instructs the timer to begin the 15-second replacement period. The official then notifies A1. After 10 seconds have elapsed: (a) the captain of Team A; or (b) the captain of Team B requests a time-out.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), the time-out request is denied as disqualified A1 must be replaced prior to any time-out being granted to either team. (2-8-4)
5.8.3
SITUATION D:
A1 or A2 requests a time-out: (a) while airborne A1 is holding the ball; (b) while A1's throw-in is in flight toward A2; or (c) when the ball is on the floor at A1's disposal for a throw-in.
RULING
:
The request is granted in (a) and (c), but denied in (b), as there is no player control while the ball is loose between players.
5.8.3
SITUATION E:
A1 is dribbling the ball in Team A's backcourt when: (a) Team B's head coach requests and is erroneously granted a time-out by an official; or (b) Team A's head coach is yelling "side out" offensive instructions to Team A and the official stops play believing the coach requested a time-out.

**RULING:** 
In (a), Team B is entitled to use the time-out since it was requested and granted; once granted it cannot be revoked and is charged to Team B. All privileges and rights permitted during a charged time-out are available to both teams. Play will resume with a Team A throw-in based on the location relative to the three-point line where play was stopped. In (b), an inadvertent whistle has occurred. Team A was not requesting a time-out, and therefore, should not be granted or charged with one. Play is resumed at the point of interruption. (4-36-1, 4-36-2a)

<!-- Page 48: Page 48 -->


### 5.8.3 SITUATION F :

A1's dribble is "interrupted" when the ball deflects off A1's shoe. A1 or a teammate asks or signals for a time-out as the ball bounces toward: (a) the sideline; or (b) the division line.
RULING
:
The request cannot be granted in (a) or (b), since A1's dribble has been "interrupted" and the ball is loose. (4-15-6c)
ERROR – NOT CORRECTABLE

### 5.8.4 SITUATION A :

The appeal of the coach of Team A to an official, made while the ball is dead and the clock is stopped, is made when it is too late for correction of an error.
RULING
:
Following the conference, the 60-second time-out remains charged to Team A and they are given the privilege of utilizing whatever time remains. The official will terminate the discussion with the coach immediately upon making a decision. If the discussion takes more than one minute, only one 60-second time-out is charged. (2-10-2, 5-11-4)

### 5.8.4 SITUATION B :

The head coach from Team A requests a 60-second time-out to rectify a timing error. The referee grants the time-out to investigate the matter, but determines that no correction can be made. The scorer then informs the referee that Team A cannot be charged a 60-second time-out as they only have one 30-second time-out remaining.
RULING
:
Since they have no 60-second time-outs remaining and there was no timing correction made, Team A will be charged its remaining 30-second time-out regardless of the amount of time consumed. (5-11-4)
CLOCK STARTS ON TOUCHING
5.9.3 SITUATION:
With two seconds on the clock in the fourth quarter, A1 is awarded one free throw with Team B leading 68-66. A1 throws the ball against the backboard and it ricochets off the ring with such force that A1 secures the rebound. A1's try for goal is successful as time expires.
RULING
:
Legal goal by A1. The clock started when A1 touched the ball. (9-1-3a)
5.9.4 SITUATION:
Thrower A1 holds the ball through the throw-in boundary plane and B1 slaps the ball out of A1's hands.
RULING
:
The clock starts when it is released by A1 as it simultaneously has been touched on the court by B1. If this had been an alternating-possession throw-in, the arrow would be reversed.
TIMING MISTAKES AND CORRECTIONS

### 5.10.1 SITUATION A :

The score is tied with two seconds remaining in the game. A1 is awarded a bonus free throw. After the ball had been placed at the disposal of A1, B1 intentionally distracts A1. The free-throw attempt is missed. The timer does not hear the official's whistle sound and permits the clock to start. May the referee put the two seconds back on the clock?

**RULING:** 
Yes. The rules provide "…the referee may correct the mistake when the referee has definite information relative to time involved." The referee not only orders the timer to put two seconds back on the clock but also awards A1 a substitute throw for the distraction by B1. (9-1-3c)

<!-- Page 49: Page 49 -->


### 5.10.1 SITUATION B :

Team A leads by one point when they inbound the ball in its backcourt with 12 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. A1's throw-in pass is to A2 who dribbles in the backcourt until the horn sounds. The trail official does not make a 10-second ruling because the "count was lost."

**RULING:** 
The game is over. The clock may not be reset as there are no rule provisions to do this. If the count was not accurate or was not made, it cannot be corrected. There is no provision for the correction of an error made in the official's accuracy in counting seconds.

### 5.10.1 SITUATION C :

As the official rules a three-second lane violation, the official properly sounds the whistle and gives the signal to stop the clock. While doing this, the official is able to see the exact time remaining in the fourth quarter. The clock shows five seconds remaining. The timer stops the clock: (a) at five seconds; (b) at four seconds; (c) at three seconds; or (d) the time runs out completely.

**RULING:** 
No correction is needed in (a). In (b), (c) and (d), the referee will order five seconds put on the clock.

### 5.10.1 SITUATION D :

There are six seconds left on the clock in the fourth quarter and Team A is inbounding the ball. The throw-in by A1 touches the official on the court and then goes across the court and out of bounds. The timer permits two seconds to run off the clock. What recourse does the coach of either team have in such situation?
RULING
:
Either coach may step to the scorer's table and request a 60-second time-out and have the referee come to the table. The coach is permitted to do this under provisions of the coach's rule. The referee shall come to the sideline and confer with one or both coaches and the timer about the matter; and if the referee has definite knowledge that there were six seconds on the clock when the ball was awarded to Team A for the throw-in, it is the responsibility of the referee to have the two seconds put back on the clock. The timer and scorer and the other official(s) can be used by the referee to gain definite information. If there is no mistake or if it cannot be rectified, the requesting team will be charged with a 60-second time-out. (5-8-4, 5-11-4 Exception b, 10-6-1c)

### 5.10.1 SITUATION E :

Team A scores a goal to lead by four points with 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Team B then quickly scores with approximately five seconds remaining; now trailing by two points. Team A expects to withhold the ball out of bounds for the throw-in with the time remaining (less than five seconds). The timer mistakenly stops the clock shortly following the Team B goal; the game clock reads 4.0 seconds remaining. The official sounds the whistle, (a) immediately to address the timing mistake; (b) after reaching a throw-in count of three to address the timing mistake; or (c) upon reaching a five-second throw-in count on Team A.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), Team A will have a throw-in from anywhere along the end line with (a) no change to the game clock; and (b) the game clock corrected to display 1.0 seconds. In (c), the game is over as time has expired.

**COMMENT:** 
An official's count may be used to correct a timing mistake. (5-10-2)

<!-- Page 50: Page 50 -->

5.10.2 SITUATION:
Following a violation in the fourth quarter, there are five seconds on the clock as A1 is bounced the ball for a throw-in. The throw-in is completed to A2. The official properly signals the clock to start and immediately begins a closely-guarded count on A2. The official reaches a count of three seconds when B1 fouls A2. The official stops play properly and reports the foul at the table. The timer reports that the clock did not start when the throw-in was touched by A2. The clock still shows five seconds.

**RULING:** 
The referee will order the clock set at two seconds. The referee has definite knowledge of the amount of time involved in this situation by using the closely-guarded count.
TIME-OUTS REMAINING

### 5.11.1 SITUATION A :

The coach for Team A requests a 30-second time-out, but it is discovered that the team does not have a 30-second time-out remaining, but does have one 60-second time-out remaining. The official grants the coach a 60-second time-out.
RULING
:
The official was correct to grant the coach of Team A the last of Team A's 60-second time-outs since the coach had already used two 60-second time-outs and two 30-second time-outs.
STATE ASSOCIATIONS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CHARGED TIME-OUTS

### 5.11.1 SITUATION B :

The state association has contractually arranged to have live telecasts of state semi-final and final games. One TV time-out each quarter will be permitted (at first dead ball closest to 3:30 remaining in quarter). The state association permits each team to have: (a) Two (2) 60 and two (2) 30-second time-outs; (b) one (1) 60 and three (3) 30-second time-outs; (c) no 60 and four (4) 30-second time-outs; or (d) one (1) 60 and two (2) 30-second time-outs.
RULING
:
State associations may reduce the number of charged time-outs, therefore, the reductions in (a), (b), (c) and (d) are allowable. (5-11-1 Note)
SHORTENED TIME-OUT
5.11.2 SITUATION:
Team A requests and is granted a 60-second time-out. After approximately 15 seconds of the time-out period has elapsed: (a) Team A comes back on the court ready to play while Team B players stay at their bench; (b) Team B is ready but Team A is not; or (c) both teams take positions and appear ready to resume play.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), the time-out period will continue as only one team is ready to play. In (c), the game will resume as soon as both teams are ready to play.
TIME-OUT REQUESTS/STARTING GAME or extra period

### 5.11.5 SITUATION A :

Team B requests a time-out: (a) as the teams position for the jump ball to start the game; (b) just prior to the toss on the jump to start the game; or (c) following the first free throw for a technical foul which occurred prior to the start of the game. Should the official grant the request?
RULING
:
The request should be denied in (a) and (b), but granted in (c). The game must be started with the ball becoming live or by a violation or foul prior to this before a

<!-- Page 51: Page 51 -->

time-out request can be honored. In (c), the ball became live when it was at the disposal of the free thrower.

### 5.11.5 SITUATION B :

Regulation play ends with a tied score. Team A has used all of its allotted time-outs. Team A requests a time-out before the overtime period begins.

**RULING:** 
The time-out should not be granted. The additional 60-second time-out provided for each extra period(s) shall not be granted until after the ball has become live to start the extra period(s).
SUCCESSIVE TIME-OUTS

### 5.11.7 SITUATION A :

Airborne shooter A1 is fouled by B1 with the try in flight. The horn then sounds ending the fourth quarter playing time. The ball continues its flight and goes through the basket to tie the score. Before A1 attempts the free throw as part of the fourth quarter, Team B captain requests and is granted a 60-second time-out. Team A or B captain then requests a 30-second time-out during the same dead-ball period.
RULING
:
The second request is denied. At the end of playing time for the fourth quarter or any overtime period, successive time-outs shall not be granted. This means a time-out cannot be granted either team until the clock has run in the extra period – assuming the free throw is missed. Successive time-outs may be granted in all situations except after time has expired in the fourth quarter or any extra period.

### 5.11.7 SITUATION B :

Following the expiration of time for the first extra period, the coach of Team B is charged with a technical foul. Team B requests a time-out before the free throws are administered to start the second extra period. The time-out request is granted. Thereafter, the official administers the first free throw to A1. Following the attempt: (a) Team B; or (b) Team A, then requests a time-out.
RULING
:
The request cannot be granted in either (a) or (b), as it would be considered a successive time-out. The fact that the ball did become live between the two requests has no bearing on the RULING. Another time-out request by either team cannot be honored until after the clock has started in the second extra period.

# Rule 6 – Live Ball and Dead Ball

Live Ball
6.1.1 COMMENT:
Unless a technical foul occurs or a player violates during the dead ball which precedes the start of the game or each extra period, the game and each extra period is started with a jump ball in the center restraining circle. A rejump may be necessary between the jumpers or if the alternating-possession procedure has not been established, a jump ball will take place between the two players involved
in causing the ball to be out of bounds,
at the center restraining circle. These situations will be the only time a jump ball will take place in a game. In all other jump-ball situations and the start of the second, third and fourth quarters,

<!-- Page 52: Page 52 -->

the alternating-procedure arrow will determine which team will have the ball for a throw-in. The team which gains control of the jump will start the alternating procedure. The arrow is immediately set pointing toward the opponent's basket. The alternating procedure can also be established by a violation or foul prior to control of the jump ball. Once established, the alternating procedure is used for the jump ball resulting from a held ball, an out-of-bounds situation where the officials cannot agree on who caused the ball to go out of bounds, a double violation, or when the ball lodges between the backboard and ring or comes to rest on the flange. (6-4)

### 6.1.2 SITUATION A :

Is the ball live: (a) during a free throw; (b) before the tossed ball is legally tapped; or (c) during a throw-in?

**RULING:** 
Yes, in all situations.

### 6.1.2 SITUATION B :

Team A has just scored a goal. The ball is bouncing close to the end line when: (a) A1 requests a time-out; or (b) A1 illegally contacts B1.
RULING
:
In order to rule correctly, it depends on whether the bouncing ball is judged to be at the thrower's disposal. If the covering official judges it is at the thrower's disposal, the official would start the count and the ball becomes live. In this case, in (a), no time-out is granted and the foul in (b), is penalized. If the ball is not at the thrower's disposal, the time-out is granted in (a), and the contact in (b), is ignored unless it is intentional or flagrant.

**COMMENT:** 
In this situation, the covering official must give the new throw-in team a moment or two to recognize it is their ball for a throw-in and get a player into the area to pick up the ball. If the ball is near the end line, it is the throw-in team's responsibility to secure it and throw-in from anywhere out of bounds along the end line. The covering official shall start the throw-in count when it is determined the ball is available. (4-4-7d)
JUMP-BALL ADMINISTRATION
6.3.2 SITUATION:
The referee is ready to toss the ball to start the game. (a) A1 who was on the center restraining circle backs off; (b) B1 moves onto the restraining circle into an unoccupied spot; (c) B2 moves off the circle and goes behind A2 and is within 3 feet of the circle; or (d) B3 moves off the circle about 5 feet and moves around behind A3 and A4 who are occupying spaces on the circle.
RULING
:
Legal in (a) and (d), but a violation in both (b) and (c). Moving off the restraining circle in (a), and around the circle when more than 3 feet away as in (d), is permissible. It is a violation to move onto the circle as in (b), until the ball leaves the official's hand, or into an occupied space as in (c), until the ball is touched. The violation by B results in a throw-in for Team A. (4-3)
6.3.7 SITUATION:
During a jump ball: (a) jumper A1 touches the ball simultaneously with both hands, then touches the ball with the right hand followed by the left hand; or (b) jumpers A1 and B1 do not touch the ball until one or both have returned to the floor.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the initial simultaneous touching counts as the first touch, touching the ball then with the right hand is the second touch and is legal. When A1 touches the tossed ball a third time with the left hand, a violation

<!-- Page 53: Page 53 -->

for touching the ball more than twice has occurred. In (b), it is legal; however, if the tossed ball contacts the floor without being touched, the official shall toss it again.
TECHNICAL BEFORE quarter STARTS
6.4.1
SITUATION A:
Twelve minutes before the game is scheduled to start, team member A1 dunks the ball and is charged with a
team
technical foul. B1,
a designated starter,
is discovered to be wearing an illegal jersey, as the players prepare for the start of the game.
Team B is charged an administrative technical foul.

**RULING:** 
Each team is assessed a foul to count towards their team-foul count. No free throws are attempted and the game begins with a jump ball.

**COMMENT:** 
Because the technical fouls occur during pregame in equal numbers, they offset.
(4-3)
arrow not reversed
6.4.1
SITUATION B:
A technical foul by B1 occurs during the dead ball which precedes the second quarter.
RULING
:
Start the second quarter by administering the free throws. The last free throw is followed by a throw-in at the division line from the side opposite the table. The possession arrow is not reversed. The opportunity for a throw-in under the alternating-possession procedure is not affected by the foul. (6-4-5, 8-5-2)
JUMP BALL TO START THE GAME
6.4.1
SITUATION C:
Following the jump between A1 and B1 to start the first quarter, the jump ball: (a) is touched by A2 and it then goes out of bounds; (b) is touched simultaneously by A2 and B2 and it then goes out of bounds; (c) is simultaneously controlled by A2 and B2; or (d) is caught by A1.
RULING
:
In (a), Team B will have a throw-in. The alternating-possession procedure is established and the arrow is set toward A's basket when a player of Team B has the ball for the throw-in. Team A will have the first opportunity to throw-in when the procedure is used. In (b) and (c), A2 and B2 will jump in the center restraining circle regardless of where the ball went out or where the held ball occurred. In (d), Team B will have a throw-in because of the violation and the arrow for the alternating-possession will be pointed towards Team A's basket. (4-12-1, 4-28-1)
ARROW MISTAKE
6.4.1
SITUATION D:
It is Team B's turn for the next throw-in under the alternating-possession procedure. By mistake, Team A is given that throw-in. Team A (a) commits a throw-in violation, or (b) releases the ball on the alternating-possession throw-in, but before the ball is legally touched inbounds, Team A or Team B commits a foul or (c) Team A completes the throw-in to teammate A2.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the throw-in ends when Team A violates and results in a throw-in for Team B as well as the arrow for the next alternating possession. In (b), the alternating-possession throw-in did not end when the foul occurred. Therefore, the alternating-possession mistake is corrected and the arrow now favors Team B; penalize the foul appropriately. In (c), any official

<!-- Page 54: Page 54 -->

may stop the game to rectify the SITUATION and award the throw-in to Team B prior to a change in team control or the ball becoming dead. (4-42-5, 6-4-4, 6-4-5, 7-6-6)
SETTING AND REVERSING THE ARROW
6.4.1
SITUATION E:
During the jump ball to start the game, after the ball is tossed: (a) B1 violates; (b) B1 fouls A1; or (c) A1 intentionally fouls B1. When is the possession arrow set?

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), when the ball is in the possession of the thrower of Team A, Team A has gained control for purposes of establishing the procedure, and the arrow is immediately pointed in the direction of B's basket. In (c), the arrow is pointed in the direction of A's basket when a player of B has the ball or it is at the thrower's disposal for the throw-in following the free throws. (4-3)
6.4.1
SITUATION F:
A team member of Team A is detected dunking five minutes before the game and a team member of Team B does the same thing one minute later.
RULING
:
Each team is assessed a team technical foul, however, no free throws are awarded. The game will begin with a jump ball at the center circle between any player from each team. The team that does not gain possession from the jump will receive the first alternating possession arrow — unless a violation occurs or the jump ball must be repeated.

**COMMENT:** 
Because the technical fouls occur during pregame in equal numbers, they offset. [7-3-2, 10-1-1 PENALTY, 10-1-2 PENALTY, 10-2-7 PENALTY (NEW). 10-5-1 PENALTY (NEW)]
Simultaneous violation
6.4.4
SITUATION A:
B1, in a marked free-throw lane space, enters the free-throw lane prematurely. The administering official properly signals the violation and A1 attempts the free throw. However, A1's attempt does not enter the basket or touch the ring.
RULING
:
The violations by B1 and A1 constitute a simultaneous free-throw violation. Unless another free throw follows, play resumes with an alternating-possession throw-in from a designated spot outside the end line.
BALL LODGES
6.4.4
SITUATION B:
A1 is fouled in the act of shooting by B1. A1's try lodges between the ring and the backboard.
RULING
:
A1 is awarded two free throws and play continues as per any similar free-throw SITUATION. Even though the ball lodged, alternating possession is not used as the ball is put in play with the free throws resulting from B1's foul. Alternating possession would have been used to resume play in this SITUATION if no foul had been committed.
LOSS OF ARROW
6.4.6
SITUATION A:
Team A is awarded the ball for a throw-in under the alternating procedure. Team A commits a violation.
RULING
:
B's ball for a throw-in because of the violation. In addition, the possession arrow is reversed and is pointed towards B's basket. Team B will have the next throw-in opportunity under the alternating procedure. Team A has lost its opportunity by virtue of the violation. A violation by Team A during an alternating-possession throw-in is the only way a

<!-- Page 55: Page 55 -->

team loses its turn under the procedure.

**COMMENT:** 
If a foul by either team occurs before an alternating-possession throw-in ends, the foul is penalized as required and play continues as it normally would, but the possession arrow is not reversed. The same team will still have the arrow for the next alternating-possession throw-in. The arrow is reversed when an alternating-possession throw-in ends. (6-4-5)
HELD BALL ON THROW-IN – NO ARROW CHANGE

### 6.4.6 SITUATION B :

During an alternating-possession throw-in, thrower A1 holds the ball through the end-line plane and B1 grabs it, resulting in a held ball.

**RULING:** 
Since the throw-in had not ended and no violation occurred, it is still A's ball for an alternating-possession throw-in. (4-42-5)
PUTTING THE BALL IN PLAY
6.5 SITUATION:
What is the procedure for putting the ball in play after: (a) a violation; (b) a charged time-out; (c) a substitution; (d) an official's time-out; (e) a successful field goal or free throw; (f) a score followed immediately by a time-out; or (g) after a common foul before the bonus rule applies.
RULING
:
In (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g), the official shall hand or bounce (as applicable by NFHS Officials Manual) the ball to the player at the spot designated for the throw-in. If there is a throw-in by Team A in its frontcourt in examples (a), (b), (d) or (g) the designated spot shall be governed by 7-5-3 and 7-5-4. In (e), the ball may be thrown in anywhere along the end line. The official shall not handle the ball unless in doing so it will prevent a delay. In (f), the official shall hand or bounce (as applicable by NFHS Officials Manual) the ball to a player of the team entitled to the throw-in, after which the throw-in may be made anywhere along the end line. (7-5-7, 8-5)
DEAD-BALL SITUATIONS

### 6.7 SITUATION A :

The ball is in flight during a try or a tap for goal by A1 when time for the third quarter expires. After time expires, the ball is on the ring or in the basket or is touching the cylinder above the basket when it is touched by: (a) A2; or (b) B1. The ball then goes through the basket or does not go through.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), the ball became dead as the try ended with the violation. In (a), no points can be scored because of the offensive basket interference by A2. However, in (b), since the touching is defensive basket interference by B1, two points are awarded to A1. Whether or not the ball goes through the basket has no effect upon either ruling. (4-6, 6-7 Note, 9-11)

### 6.7 SITUATION B :

After A1 starts the free-throwing motion, A2 commits a foul by pushing B1.
RULING
:
If the foul occurred after the ball was in flight, the point counts if the throw was successful and no substitute throw is awarded if not successful. If A1 had not released the free-throw attempt before A2 fouled B1, the ball became dead when the team-control foul occurred and A1 is permitted an unhindered free throw. The foul by A2 results in the ball being awarded to Team B at the out-of-bounds spot based on the location relative to the three-point line to

<!-- Page 56: Page 56 -->

where A2 fouled B1, unless the free-throw attempt by A1 is successful in which case B will throw-in from out of bounds anywhere along the end line where the free throw was scored. (4-19-7, 4-19-9, 7-5-7)
CONTINUOUS MOTION
6.7
COMMENT
:
If an opponent fouls after A1 has started a try for field goal, A1 is permitted to complete the customary arm movement; and, if A1 is pivoting or stepping when A1 or a teammate is fouled, A1 may complete the usual foot or body movement in any activity, as long as A1 is still holding the ball. If A1 starts a dribble, the "continuous motion" immediately ends. These privileges are granted only when the usual throwing motion has started before the foul occurs. The continuous-motion rule applies to a free-throw try as well as to a try or tap for field goal. However, in a tap for goal, the motion does not begin until the ball is touched.
The "continuous-motion" provision does not apply to batting or tipping the ball during rebounding or a jump ball. In these cases, A1 is not considered as being in the act of trying or tapping for field goal. If an opponent commits a foul during this type of action before the ball is in flight, the foul causes the ball to become dead immediately. In rebounding, the ball is not always batted. It might be caught in one hand and then thrown into the basket with a snap of the wrist or fingers or touched and tapped toward the basket. Under these circumstances, an official is justified in ruling that it is a try or tap for field goal instead of a bat. Continuous motion is of significance only when there is a personal or technical foul by B after the trying or tapping motion by A1 is started and before the ball is in flight. It includes any body, foot or arm motion normally used in trying for a field goal or free throw, and it ends when the ball leaves the hand(s) on the try or tap for field goal. (4-11)

### 6.7 SITUATION C :

Under what circumstances does the ball remain live when a foul occurs just prior to the ball being in flight during a try or tap for field goal?

**RULING:** 
The ball would ordinarily become dead at once, but it remains live if the foul is by the defense, and this foul occurs after A1 has started the try or tap for field goal and time does not expire before the ball is in flight. The foul by the defense may be either personal or technical and the exception to the rule applies to field goal tries and taps and free-throw tries. (4-11, 4-41-1)

### 6.7 SITUATION D :

A1 has started a try for a field goal (is in the act of shooting), but the ball is not yet in flight when the official blows the whistle for B2 fouling A2. A1's try is successful.

**RULING:** 
Score the goal by A1. If Team A is in the bonus, A2 will shoot free throws. If not, Team A will have a throw-in at one of the four designated spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line to where the foul occurred.

**COMMENT:** 
The foul by the defense need not be on the player in the act of shooting for continuous motion principles to apply. (6-7 Exception c)

<!-- Page 57: Page 57 -->

DEAD BALL – LIVE BALL

### 6.7 SITUATION E :

Prior to the bonus and after A1 starts the free-throwing motion: B5 fouls A5.

**RULING:** 
The "continuous motion" rule applies and A1 may release the ball and if the throw is successful, the point counts. Award Team A the ball out of bounds
at one of the four designated frontcourt spots
. (7-5-3, 7-5-4)
6.7.4 SITUATION:
Airborne A1 is fouled by B1 during a try or tap for field goal. After the ball is in flight, A1 illegally contacts B2 in returning to the floor. The ball goes through the basket.
RULING
:
The foul by B1 did not cause the ball to become dead since A1 had started the trying or tapping motion. However, airborne shooter A1's foul is a player-control foul which does cause the ball to become dead immediately. No goal can be scored even if the ball had already gone through the basket before the foul. Since the goal is unsuccessful, A1 is awarded two free throws for the foul by B1. No players are allowed in the free-throw lane spaces as Team B will be awarded the ball following the last free throw. If the last throw is successful, the throw-in is from anywhere along the end line. If the last throw is unsuccessful, the throw-in is from one of the four designated spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line. The SITUATION is a false double foul. (4-11, 4-19-6)
6.7.6
SITUATION A:
A1 passes the ball to A2. However, A2 is not looking. The ball strikes A2 on the back of the head, and then goes directly above the basket of Team A. The ball is on the ring when time expires and subsequently it enters the basket.
RULING
:
No goal. The ball rebounding from A2's head is not considered a try or a tap for field goal. A try or tap for field goal is made with the hand(s). In this SITUATION, since it was not a try or tap for field goal, the ball became dead immediately when time expired. (4-41-5)
6.7.6
SITUATION B:
A1 taps the ball and it enters the basket: (a) before time expires; or (b) after time expires.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), it is a legal field goal and two points are scored. In both (a) and (b), a tap ends exactly as a try for field goal. (4-41-5)
6.7.7 SITUATION:
As the hand of A1 contacts the ball to tap it toward Team A's basket, B1 fouls A1. The ball definitely is not airborne from the hand of A1 when the contact occurs, but the tapped ball goes into the basket.
RULING
:
The foul does not cause the ball to become dead immediately. The subsequent tap of the ball results in a field goal, the same as a try for field goal. The foul is penalized the same as being fouled in the act of shooting. Continuous motion does apply to a tap. (4-11, 4-41-2, 4-41-5)
6.7.9 SITUATION:
A1 is fouled in the act of shooting by B1. While the ball is in the cylinder above the basket, A2 touches the ball.
RULING
:
The basket interference by A2 causes the ball to become dead and no goal can be scored. However, A1 is awarded two free throws for being fouled in the act of shooting an unsuccessful try. Players must occupy free-throw lane spaces as required and play continues as per rule when the last free throw is made or missed. (9-11)

<!-- Page 58: Page 58 -->


# Rule 7 – Out of Bounds and the Throw-in

PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS

### 7.1.1 SITUATION A :

A1, while holding the ball inbounds near the sideline, is aided to stay in-bounds by touching (a) player B1; (b) a photographer; (c) a coach; (d) an official, all of whom are out of bounds.

**RULING:** 
A1 is out of bounds in (a), (b), (c) or (d).

**COMMENT:** 
When A1 gains an advantage by touching a player/person on or outside a boundary in order to remain in-bounds, A1 is out of bounds. Inadvertent contact with a player or person that does not aid in a player remaining in-bounds is not considered a violation.

### 7.1.1 SITUATION B :

A1 blocks a pass near the end line. The ball falls to the floor inbounds, but A1, who is off balance, steps off the court. A1 returns inbounds, secures control of the ball and dribbles.
RULING
:
Legal. A1 did not leave the court on A1's own volition and did not have control of the ball when leaving. This situation is similar to one in which A1 makes a try from under the basket and momentum carries A1 off the court. If the try is unsuccessful, A1 may come back onto the court and regain control since A1 did not leave the court on A1's own volition and did not have control of the ball when leaving.

### 7.1.1 SITUATION C :

A1 blocks a pass near the sideline and the ball goes into A1's front court. A1's momentum carries A1 out of bounds. A1 immediately returns inbounds, secures control of the ball, dribbles, shoots, and scores.
RULING
:
Legal. (4-35-1a, 7-1-2, 9-3)

### 7.1.1 SITUATION D :

A1 jumps from inbounds to retrieve an errant pass near a boundary line. A1 catches the ball while in the air, gaining player control, and tosses it back to the court. A1 lands out of bounds and (a) is the first to touch the ball after returning inbounds; (b) returns inbounds and immediately dribbles the ball; or (c) picks up the ball after returning to the court and then begins a dribble.
RULING
:
Legal in (a) and (b). Illegal in (c) as the controlled toss of the ball to the court by A1 constitutes the start of a dribble, dribbling a second time after picking up the ball is an illegal dribble violation. (4-15-5, 4-15-6d, 4-35, 9-5)
BALL OVER BACKBOARD

### 7.1.2 SITUATION A :

The ball strikes the side edge or top edge of the backboard or passes over the top of the backboard and the ball: (a) came from a throw-in from behind the plane of the backboard; or (b) from a pass or try from the front or back of the plane of the backboard. The ball does not touch any supporting brace.
RULING
:
If a fan-shaped backboard is being used in (a) and in (b), the ball remains live. If a rectangular backboard is used in (a), the ball remains live after touching the side edge or top edge, but it is a violation if it passes directly over the backboard. In (b), the ball remains live if it touches a side edge or the top edge if

<!-- Page 59: Page 59 -->

it rebounds and comes down in front of the backboard. The ball becomes dead if it passes over the top of a rectangular backboard regardless of the action which causes it to pass over or whether it comes from the front or back of the plane.
OUT-OF-BOUNDS SITUATIONS

### 7.1.2 SITUATION B :

A1, while dribbling, touches: (a) B1 who is standing on a sideline; or (b) a nearby chair or scorer's table while A1's feet are inbounds.
RULING
:
(a) A1 is inbounds. However, if the ball in control of A1 touches B1, the ball is out of bounds and is awarded to Team A at that spot. In (b), A1 is out of bounds and, therefore, the ball is considered to have gone out of bounds. (7-2)

### 7.1.2 SITUATION C :

A1 is dribbling in Team A's backcourt when the ball is deflected by B1. The ball gets away and contacts a child who is (a) walking inbounds (on the playing court); or (b) walking out of bounds. The official sounds the whistle.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the ball is not out of bounds since the person contacted, the child, was inbounds. However, for safety reasons the official should stop play and resume from the point of interruption. Team A, the team last in control, will be awarded a throw-in at one of the four designated spots in the backcourt based on where the ball was located relative to the three-point line when play was interrupted. B1 has committed an out-of-bounds violation in (b). (4-36, 7-2-1)
VIOLATION – THROW-IN SPOT
7.4 SITUATION:
What and where is the violation when: (a) A1 grabs a rebound at Team A's basket and passes the ball back across the division line after which it is touched by A2 in the backcourt; (b) A1, in a corner near B's end line, throws a long pass which crosses the sideline in flight at the division line and touches in the bleachers near A's end-line extended; or (c) a throw-in by A1 from the sideline opposite the team bench in Team A's frontcourt goes through A's basket before touching another player on the court?
RULING
:
In (a), the violation is not for causing the ball to go into the backcourt, but for A2 touching it first after it went there. The throw-in for Team B is in the backcourt at one of the four designated spots nearest to where the violation occurred relative to the three-point line. In (b), the violation is for causing the ball to be out of bounds, but since the ball is not out of bounds until it touches something, the violation occurs when the ball touches the bleachers and the throw-in by B is at the out-of-bounds spot nearest such touching. In (c), the throw-in violation is by A1 for throwing the ball so that it enters the basket before touching another player on the court. The throw-in by B in (c) is from the spot of A1's throw-in since Team B is gaining possession in its backcourt. (7-5-3b, 9-2-2, 9-9-1)
THROW-IN DELAY following time-out

### 7.5.1 SITUATION A :

The administering official has reached a five-second throw-in count on Team A after placing the ball on the floor when Team A was not ready to resume play following a time-out. What happens next?

**RULING:** 
If Team A committed the violation in its frontcourt or backcourt, the violation is administered and the

<!-- Page 60: Page 60 -->

ball is made available to Team B for a throw-in at one of the four designated spots based on the location of the throw-in violation relative to the three-point line. If a Team B player is not in position, the same procedure is followed. If both teams have violated, a technical foul will be assessed for any further delay by either team. Team A must now have a thrower available, plus all other players on the court and Team B must be on the court ready to play also. If either or both teams are not in compliance immediately, a technical foul shall be charged. (4-38, 5-4-1, 7-5-3, 9-2-4)
7.5.1
SITUATION B:
Team A does not break the huddle after the second horn for a 60-second time-out. The official puts the ball down at the designated spot and begins the five-second count. The administering official is between four and five on the count when Team B reaches over the boundary and grabs the ball.

**RULING:** 
Delay-of-game warning on Team B for reaching across the plane. No Team A member ever possessed the ball for the throw-in; therefore, a technical foul would not be assessed. (10-2-5)
DETERMINING THROW-IN SPOT
7.5.3
SITUATION A:
A1 is dribbling the ball outside the three-point line in Team A's frontcourt near its team bench when (a) B1 fouls A1; (b) B2 fouls A2 near Team A's basket on the opposite side of the court; (c) B1 kicks the ball when A1 attempts to pass to A2.

**RULING:** 
In (a), (b) and (c), play will resume with a throw-in at one of the four designated spots based on where the foul/violation occurred relative to the three-point line.

**COMMENT:** 
In (a) and (c), the throw-in will occur at the 28-foot mark near the team bench. In (b), the throw-in will take place 3 feet outside of the lane nearest to where the foul occurred relative to the three-point line. (7-5-3)
7.5.3
SITUATION B:
A1 inbounds the ball to A2 in Team A's backcourt and (a) is fouled by B2; (b) B2 kicks the ball; (c) there is an inadvertent whistle by the official.

**RULING:** 
In (a), (b) and (c), Team A retains control and play shall resume at either the point of interruption or
at one of the four designated spots based on where the foul/violation occurred, relative to the three-point line.

**COMMENT:** 
Since the foul/violation/dead ball occurred in the team's backcourt and Team A is not in the bonus, in (a) and (b), play is resumed at one of the four designated spots based on where the foul/violation occurred, relative to the three-point line. In (c), play will resume at the point of interruption at one of the four designated spots based on where the inadvertent whistle occurred, relative to the three-point line.
7.5.3
SITUATION C:
Team A has control of the ball in its frontcourt when the ball is deflected out of bounds by Team B along the end line close to the right sideline. Team A is awarded a throw-in at the location where the ball landed out of bounds. While Team A is trying to inbound the ball, Team A is granted a time-out. Following the time-out, where should play be resumed?

**RULING:** 
Since the ball was not on the court, the time-out did not create a “stoppage in play” that would move the throw-in spot to one of the four frontcourt designated spots. Play will continue from the throw-in spot established by the deflection of the ball by Team B. (7-5-2
)

<!-- Page 61: Page 61 -->

DESIGNATED SPOT
7.5.5 SITUATION:
Where is the ball awarded to the offended team when prior to the bonus: (a) while trying for goal A1 charges B1 and then releases the ball and it goes through Team A's basket; or (b) airborne shooter A1 charges into B1 after which A2 touches the ball while it is in the cylinder?
RULING
:
In both (a) and (b), the goal does not count and the throw-in by B will be awarded the ball based on where the foul occurred relative to the three-point line. (2-9-2)
THROW-IN SPOTS

### 7.5.7 SITUATION A :

B1 goaltends on airborne shooter A1's try. A1 fouls B1 before A1 returns to the floor.
RULING
:
Since no free throws result from the player-control foul, B's throw-in is from anywhere along the end line because of the awarded goal for B1's goaltending violation. (9-12 Penalty 1)

### 7.5.7 SITUATION B :

Team A scores a field goal and is immediately granted a time-out. At the conclusion of the time-out, Team B returns to the court and all five players go out-of-bounds as the official hands/bounces the ball to B1. B2 and B3 then step inbounds and B2 receives a pass from B1. The other players from Team B then enter the court.

**RULING:** 
Legal throw-in. After a goal, even if there was a time-out, Team B has the ability to move along the end line for the throw-in and, therefore, can have multiple players along the end line out-of-bounds for the throw-in.

### 7.5.7 SITUATION C :

Team B has scored a field goal and A1 has the ball along the end line for a throw-in. Team A is not in the bonus. Prior to the ball being thrown inbounds by A1: (a) B1 fouls A2 inbounds near A1; (b) B1 fouls A2 in front of the division line; (c) B1 fouls A2 beyond the division line; or (d) A2 requests a time-out.
RULING
:
In (a) and (d), Team A may throw-in from anywhere out of bounds along the end line following the foul reporting and the time-out. In (b), the ball will be given to Team A for a throw-in from one of the four designated spots out of bounds relative to the three-point line in the frontcourt or backcourt depending on where the foul occurred, and in (c), the ball will be given to Team A for a throw-in from one of the four designated spots based on where the foul occurred relative to the three-point line in Team A's frontcourt.

### 7.5.7 SITUATION D :

Team A scores a field goal. B1 picks up the ball and steps out of bounds at the end line to prepare for a throw-in. Before the throw-in is completed, A2 commits an intentional (or flagrant) foul on B3 near the end line.
RULING
:
B3 would shoot the two free throws for the intentional (or flagrant) foul with the free-throw lane spaces cleared. Team B will then have a designated spot throw-in on the end line. (10-4 PENALTY)

### 7.5.7 SITUATION E :

While A1's three-point field-goal attempt is in flight, A3 fouls B1 (B is not in the bonus). The three-point field-goal attempt is successful.
RULING
:
Score the three-point goal for A1. Team B will be permitted to move along the end line on the ensuing throw-in. (6-7-7 Exception b)

<!-- Page 62: Page 62 -->


### 7.5.7 SITUATION F :

A1 is fouled during an unsuccessful try for field goal and is awarded two free throws. While A1's successful first free throw is in flight, A2 fouls B1 along the free throw lane. Team B is not in the bonus. The free-throw lane spaces are cleared for A1's second attempt. A1 then violates by having a foot through the free-throw-line plane prematurely.
RULING
:
The free-throw violation by A1 cancels the second attempt. Since Team B is not in the bonus, it results in a designated spot throw-in from one of the four designated spots out of bounds based on where A2's foul occurred relative to the three-point line. Team B may not move along the end line as the last free throw was unsuccessful. (9-1-3e)

### 7.5.7 SITUATION G :

Team A scores a field goal. B1 immediately picks up the ball and steps out of bounds for the thrown-in, while B2, B3, B4 and B5 also step out-of-bounds beyond the end line. In (a), B1 then passes the ball into either B2, B3, B4 and B5 after they have gained inbounds status; (b), B1 throws the ball to B4 who is standing out-of-bounds, who then completes the throw-in to B3 inbounds.

**RULING:** 
Legal throw-in in (a) and (b).
BACKBOARD SUPPORTS
7.6.2 SITUATION:
During a throw-in, A1 passes the ball over the braces supporting a rectangular backboard. The ball does not touch any of the braces and is subsequently controlled by A2, who throws the ball in Team A's basket. The ball did not pass over any part of the rectangular backboard.
RULING
:
The ball was live and the throw-in ended when it was touched by A2, thus A2 scored a field goal. This play is somewhat different than those most frequently used to bring out the point that the ball becomes dead when it passes over a rectangular board. The rules do not identify the supports as being part of the backboard. (5-1, 7-1-2b)
THROW-IN PLANE

### 7.6.4 SITUATION A :

While attempting a throw-in, A1 holds the ball through the plane of the end line. B1: (a) slaps the ball from A1's hand(s); or (b) simply grabs the ball and then throws it through B's basket.
RULING
:
In (a), no violation has occurred and play continues. In (b), score two points for Team B.

### 7.6.4 SITUATION B :

A1 is attempting to make a throw-in and Team B is applying a great deal of pressure. B1 reaches through the boundary-line plane and waves a hand in an effort to prevent the pass. The action takes place on a court which has more than 3 feet of unobstructed space outside the boundary line.
RULING
:
Team B is warned for violation of the boundary plane. The warning is reported to the scorer and to the coach and applies for the rest of the game. Any subsequent delay-of-game situation by Team B shall result in a technical foul charged to Team B. (9-2-10, 10-2-1c)

### 7.6.4 SITUATION C :

The sideline is very near the spectators leaving little space out of bounds for A1 to make a throw-in. As a result, the administering official has directed B1 to move back a step to give the thrower some room. As soon as the ball is handed or bounced to A1, B1 moves right back to the boundary line in front

<!-- Page 63: Page 63 -->

of A1.
RULING
:
It is a violation by B1 and will also result in a warning for Team B which is reported to the scorer and to the head coach. Any subsequent delay-of-game situation or noncompliance with the verbal order will result in a technical foul charged to Team B. (10-2-1c)

### 7.6.4 SITUATION D :

Following a goal, A1 is moving along the end line when B1 reaches through the plane in an attempt to prevent the throw-in.
RULING
:
Team B is warned for the violation which is reported to the scorer and to the head coach. A1 may move along the end line during the subsequent throw-in.

### 7.6.4 SITUATION E :

Thrower A1 inadvertently holds the ball through the end-line plane during a throw-in. B1 is able to get both hands on the ball and A1 cannot pull it back.
RULING
:
A held ball is ruled, resulting in an alternating-possession throw-in. If the original throw-in is an alternating-possession throw-in, Team A still has the arrow following the held ball.
positions parallel to end line
7.6.5 SITUATION:
Prior to a throw-in on the end line near A's basket, A1, A2 and A3 line up shoulder-to-shoulder parallel to the line and: (a) within 3 feet of it; or (b) more than 3 feet from it. In both cases, Team B requests space between the Team A players.
RULING
:
In (a), the request is granted and a Team B player may position between each of the Team A players. In (b), the request is denied.
THROW-IN BY WRONG TEAM by mistake
7.6.6 SITUATION:
Team A is awarded a throw-in near the division line. The administering official by mistake, puts the ball at B1's disposal. B1 completes the throw-in and (a) Team B subsequently scores a goal and A1 completes an inbound pass to A2 before the officials realize the mistake; (b) the officials realize the mistake while Team B still has control and before the next dead ball; (c) Team A steals the ball and gains control.

**RULING:** 
In (a), no correction can be made for the mistake by the official after Team B scores and the ball has become dead. In (b), any official may stop the game to rectify the situation, add time back on the clock if they have definite knowledge, and award the throw-in to Team A. In (c), allow the game to continue as possession has changed.

# Rule 8 – Free Throw

placing at disposal

### 8.1.1 SITUATION A :

A1 is awarded two free throws. After the players have had sufficient opportunity and time to take their positions for the first throw, the administering official bounces the ball to the free thrower. Did the official follow proper procedure?

**RULING:** 
Yes. On free throws, the word "disposal" is interpreted to mean that the official shall bounce the ball to the free thrower, but if the free thrower refuses to accept it, the official may place the ball on the floor at the free-throw line and begin the count.

<!-- Page 64: Page 64 -->

This procedure constitutes putting the ball at the free-thrower's disposal. However, in this SITUATION, the ball becomes live when it is caught by the free thrower. (4-4-7b)
DELAY – TEAM WARNING
8.1.1
SITUATION B:
B1 fouls A1 during an unsuccessful try for field goal. The RULING official has properly reported the foul and is in position for the free throws. The administering official has given all instructions and signals. Team B is properly occupying the required spaces, but three teammates of A1 are huddling inside the free-throw lane.
RULING
:
Team A is warned for delay, the scorer records it and it is reported to the head coach. If Team A commits any delay thereafter in the game, a team technical foul shall be charged. (10-2-1d)
LANE SPACE REGULATIONS
8.1.3 SITUATION:
Players attempt to take positions along the free-throw lane when: (a) the free throw is from the first foul of a false double foul and the last part is a double personal foul; (b) the free throw is between quarters; or (c) there is a multiple throw with the first for a personal and last for a technical foul.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the first marked spaces may only be occupied by opponents of the thrower during free throw(s) for the personal foul and other marked spaces may properly be occupied unless the free-throw lane spaces are to be cleared by rule. In (b) and (c), the official should order the players away. (4-19-8a, 4-36-1, 4-36-2b, 8-1-4, 8-6)
8.1.4
SITUATION A:
A1 is at the free-throw line for the first attempt of a bonus SITUATION. In (a), two Team B and two Team A players occupy the first and second marked free-throw lane spaces, respectively. B3 occupies one of the third marked free-throw lane spaces. A3 attempts to occupy the vacant third marked lane space; or (b) two Team B players occupy the first marked lane spaces. The offense chooses not to occupy any marked free-throw lane spaces. Two more Team B players choose to occupy the second marked lane spaces.

**RULING:** 
Illegal in (a), A3 is not permitted to occupy the third marked free-throw lane space. Only two offensive players may occupy marked free-throw lane spaces during a free throw. If the improper alignment is not corrected prior to the thrower having the ball at the thrower's disposal, a free-throw violation shall be called on Team A immediately. Legal in (b), four defensive players are permitted in any of the first three vacant marked free-throw lane spaces.
8.1.4
SITUATION B:
A1 is fouled and is at the free-throw line. Team B refuses to occupy the first marked free-throw lane spaces.
RULING
:
A technical foul shall be charged to Team B for unsporting conduct. The free-throw lane spaces shall be cleared and A1 shall be given the warranted free throws. Team A's coach will then designate who will shoot the free throws for the technical foul. The technical foul free throws will be shot. The ball will then be administered at the division line to Team A. (10-4-5)

<!-- Page 65: Page 65 -->

DESIGNATED FREE THROWER

### 8.2 SITUATION A :

A1 is unable to attempt either of the two free throws awarded because A1 was injured during the play. A6 enters, replaces A1 and attempts the first free throw. A7 reports and enters to replace A6.
RULING
:
A7 must return to the bench and A6 remains in the game to attempt the second free throw. Since A6 replaced A1, A6 must shoot both free throws, unless A6 is injured or disqualified before attempting the second free throw. If this situation involved technical foul free throws, A7 would be allowed to enter and attempt the second free throw. (8-2, 8-3)

### 8.2 SITUATION B :

A1 is fouled and will be shooting two free throws. After A1's first free-throw attempt, B6 (Team B's only remaining eligible substitute) replaces B2. A1's second free-throw attempt is unsuccessful. During rebounding action for A1's missed second free-throw attempt, and before the clock starts, A1 pushes B3 in the back causing B3 to roll an ankle. Team B is in the bonus. B3 is unable to immediately continue playing. Team B requests and is granted a time out in order to allow B3 to recover from the ankle injury so as to remain in the game. B3 is still not able to play after the time out has ended.

**RULING:** 
B2 may return to the game and replace B3 and shoot B3's free throw attempts despite having been replaced since B2 is the only available substitute. (3-3-4, 2-3)
8.3 SITUATION:
A technical foul is issued prior to the start of the game and the game begins with free throws. Non-starter, A6, is brought in to the game to attempt the free throws and replaces starter A5.

**RULING:** 
Legal substitute. The ball becomes live to start the game when placed at A6's disposal. A6 and A5 are subject to proper substitution rules. A5 may not re-enter until the next opportunity to substitute after the clock has been properly started. (3-2-2a, 3-3-4)
PUTTING THE BALL IN PLAY

### 8.6.2 SITUATION A :

Team A is assessed with a technical foul. Immediately after the ball is bounced to B1 at the free-throw line, A2 flagrantly contacts B2 in Team B's frontcourt and is assessed a flagrant personal foul. A2 is disqualified.
RULING
:
Players will not be permitted to take positions along the lane for the technical-foul throws or for the free throws for the flagrant personal foul by A2. Following B2's two throws, Team B will be awarded the ball for a throw-in at one of the four designated spots based on the location of A2's foul relative to the three-point line in Team B's frontcourt. (8-5-3)

### 8.6.2 SITUATION B :

B1 fouls A1 just as the first quarter ends and then A1 retaliates and intentionally contacts B1. A1's foul is a technical foul as it occurred during a dead ball. Team A is in the bonus. The officials by mistake administer the penalty for the technical foul before the free throw(s) by A1.
RULING
:
The penalties should have been administered in the order in which the fouls occurred. However, since all merited free throws were attempted it does not constitute a correctable error situation. The second quarter will begin with an alternating-possession throw-in. (4-19-5c)

<!-- Page 66: Page 66 -->


### 8.6.2 SITUATION C :

During the dead-ball period immediately following a goal by A1, B1 is charged with an unsporting technical foul for using profanity toward A1. A few seconds later, A2 is charged with an unsporting technical foul for taunting B1. Are free throws awarded or are the fouls considered to have occurred simultaneously with offsetting penalties?
RULING
:
The fouls did not occur simultaneously and free throws are awarded in the order in which the fouls occurred. Team A will attempt two free throws followed by Team B's two attempts. Following the second attempt by Team B, Team B will have a throw-in from the division line opposite the table. (4-19-9, 4-19-10)

### 8.6.3 SITUATION A :

A1 is attempting the second free throw of a two-shot foul. While the second free throw is in flight, A2 and B1 punch each other simultaneously.
RULING
:
Both A2 and B1 are disqualified for fighting. Since this is a double personal foul, no free throws are awarded. The ball is put in play at the point of interruption. If A1's free throw is successful, Team B is awarded a throw-in from anywhere along the end line. If A1's free throw is unsuccessful, the alternating-possession procedure is used. (4-19-8, 4-36, 6-4-4, 10-4-8)

### 8.6.3 SITUATION B :

A1 and B1 commit personal fouls against each other at the same time. The coach of Team A takes exception to the ruling and is charged with a technical foul.
RULING
:
There are no free throws for the double personal foul committed by A1 and B1. Team B is awarded two free throws and the ball out of bounds at the division line for the technical foul charged directly to the coach of Team A. (4-19-8, 4-19-9, 10-5-1e)

# Rule 9 – Violations and Penalties

free-throwER LOSES BALL
9.1.1 SITUATION:
A1, at the free-throw line to attempt a free throw: (a) muffs the pass from the official and it rolls forward; or (b) while performing a pre-shot routine prior to the release, accidentally allows the ball to deflect off A1's foot into the free-throw lane.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the official should sound the whistle to prevent any violations and then start the free throw procedure again. No free-throw violation should be ruled in this situation. In (b), a free-throw violation shall be called on A1. (9-1-3a, e)
FREE THROW DELAY FOLLOWING A TIME-OUT

### 9.1.2 SITUATION A :

Following a time-out by Team B, A1 is given the ball for the first of two free throws even though Team B is still huddling at the bench and the first marked spaces on each side of the free-throw lane are not occupied. In this case, the lead official uses the resumption-of-play procedure even though the first spaces are not occupied, whereas in other cases, the spaces would have

<!-- Page 67: Page 67 -->

to be properly occupied before the official would proceed with the free throw administration. A1's first attempt is successful. The lead official then bounces the ball to A1 for the second attempt. Team B is still at the sideline. The official again gives the signal which indicates a violation by Team B if the attempt is missed. A1 misses the second free-throw attempt.

**RULING:** 
The violation will result in A1 being given a substitute attempt. Team B will be assessed a technical foul for any further delay by not occupying the first marked spaces on each side of the lane before the ball becomes live for the substitute throw. (4-38, 8-1-2, 10-4-5c)
DEFENSE AND OFFENSE IN OPPOSITE free-throw lane SPACES

### 9.1.2 SITUATION B :

A1 is shooting the first of a bonus free-throw situation. A4 and A5 are positioned in the first two marked free-throw lane spaces (near the end line) and B4 and B5 are positioned in the second two marked free-throw lane spaces. The incorrect alignment is discovered by the officials: (a) before the ball is at the disposal of A1; (b) after the ball is at A1's disposal, but before the try is in flight; (c) when the try is in flight; (d) when the successful try goes through the cylinder.
RULING
:
In (a), the administering official shall "reset" the free throw and put the players in their properly marked free-throw lane spaces. In (b) and (c) an official shall sound the whistle immediately and call a simultaneous violation. A1 will shoot the second free throw. In (d), the free throw has ended and the improper alignment is ignored and the players are put in their properly marked free-throw lane spaces. (4-20-3, 9-1-2 Penalty 3)
FAKING

### 9.1.3 SITUATION A :

A1, at the free throw line to attempt a final free throw, fakes the release of the ball.
RULING
:
A violation by A1, Team B will be awarded a throw-in at one of the two designated spots along the end line.

**COMMENT:** 
The faking of a free throw try is a violation. However, if A1 does not feel comfortable after starting the motion and stops to adjust, the players in the free-throw lane spaces are expected to hold their positions. (9-1-3b)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION B :

Prior to A1 releasing the ball on a free throw attempt: (a) B1; or (b) A2, in a marked free-throw lane space, fakes by rocking forward causing an opponent to enter the free-throw lane prematurely.
RULING
:
In (a), the official will use the proper signal indicating a delayed violation by B1 and a substitute free throw is awarded if A1's attempt is unsuccessful. If it is successful, the violation is ignored. In (b), the official will sound the whistle immediately when A2 violates. The violation cancels A1's attempt and it is B's ball for a throw-in, unless an additional free throw(s) is involved.
COMMENT
:
If a player uses verbal tactics like "you're in my space" or a time-out request to fake an opponent into violations, only the fake is penalized. (9-1-3b Penalty 1, 9-1-3b Penalty 4d)

<!-- Page 68: Page 68 -->


### 9.1.3 SITUATION C :

A1 is preparing to attempt a free throw. Prior to A1's release of the ball, B1 fakes causing A2 to enter the free-throw lane prematurely. A1 then requests and is granted a time-out.

**RULING:** 
Upon resuming play, A1 is entitled to a free throw and the official shall use the proper signal indicating a delayed violation by B1 prior to the granting of the time-out. If the free throw is successful, the violation is ignored, if unsuccessful a substitute throw is awarded. (9-1-3b)
OPPONENTS Distract

### 9.1.3 SITUATION D :

The ball is at the disposal of free thrower A1. B1, within the visual field of A1: (a) raises both arms above the head; or (b) after B1's arms have been extended above the head, alternately opens and closes both hands.
RULING
:
B1 may be penalized in both (a) and (b). If the act in either (a) or (b) distracts the free throw shooter A1, it shall be penalized. The free thrower is entitled to protection from being distracted. It is the opponent's responsibility to avoid distracting the free thrower. (9-1-3c Penalty 2)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION E :

After A1 starts the free-throw motion, B1 commits a common foul on A2 along the free-throw lane before the bonus rule is in effect.
RULING
:
Even if the foul occurs before the ball is in flight, the throw counts if successful. No substitute try is awarded if the throw is missed. In either case, whether the throw is made or missed, the ball is awarded to Team A at one of the two designated end line spots nearest to where the foul occurred. If A1 has been distracted, a substitute throw shall be awarded if the try is unsuccessful. (4-11, 9-1-3c Penalty 2)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION F :

A1 steps on the free-throw line before releasing the ball in an attempt, after which B1 distracts.
RULING
:
The ball became dead when A1 violated by stepping on the line, therefore, the action of B1 is ignored. The ball is awarded to Team B out of bounds at one of the two designated spots along the end line. (7-5-5, 9-1-3e Penalty 1)
free-throw lane SPACE REGULATIONS

### 9.1.3 SITUATION G :

While A1 is attempting a final free throw, (a) B1 enters the lane too soon followed by A2, both of whom are in marked lane spaces; or (b) B1, in a marked lane space enters the lane too soon, then shooter A1 steps on the free-throw line while releasing the throw.
RULING
:
In (a), the violation by A2 is ignored and, if the try is successful, the goal shall count and the violation by B1, shall be ignored. If the try is unsuccessful, the ball shall become dead when the free throw ends and a substitute free throw shall be attempted by A1 under the same conditions as those for the original free throw. In (b), a double violation is ruled and the ball is put in play using the alternating-possession procedure.

**COMMENT:** 
Anytime the defense violates first, followed by a violation by the free-throw shooter, the officials should consider the possibility of distraction. (9-1 Penalty)

<!-- Page 69: Page 69 -->


### 9.1.3 SITUATION H :

During a free throw by A1, B1 pushes A2, then B2, who is in a marked free-throw lane space, enters the free-throw lane too soon: (a) before A1 has started a free-throwing motion; or (b) after A1 has started a throwing motion.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the foul by B1 causes the ball to become dead immediately, therefore the act, by B2 is ignored. A1 is permitted the specified number of free throws, after which the foul is penalized. In (b), the foul does not cause the ball to become dead immediately, so there are two infractions. Even though the foul occurred first, the violation is the first to be penalized if A1's try is unsuccessful. (4-11, 6-7 Exception c, 9-1 Penalty 2)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION I :

The official administering a free throw awarded to A1 places the ball at A1's disposal. A1, who is inside the free-throw semicircle leaves the semicircle to confer with a teammate.

**RULING:** 
Violation. After the ball has been placed at the disposal of the free thrower, the free thrower is not permitted to leave or enter the free-throw semicircle without violating, until restrictions have ended. (9-1-3e Penalty 1)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION J :

During a free throw by A1, B1 is positioned just behind the three-point line at the top of the semicircle. Is B1's position legal and what restrictions are in effect on B1?

**RULING:** 
The position of B1 is legal. B1 may move freely but may not break the vertical plane of the three-point line and the free-throw line extended with either foot until after the ball touches the ring or until the free throw has ended. (9-1-3f PenaltY 1)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION K :

Before the ball is released on a free-throw attempt by A1, B1 in a marked free-throw lane space: (a) with a foot, breaks the vertical plane of the side edge of the area between the first and second lane spaces; (b) steps on the outside edge of the free-throw lane-line boundary; (c) loses his or her balance and touches the inside of the free-throw lane with both hands; or (d) extends arms over the area between the free-throw lane spaces.

**RULING:** 
Violation in (a), (b) and (c). Legal in (d), if there is no illegal contact. Stepping on or breaking (with a foot) the plane of any boundary spaces along the free-throw lane or around the three-point line are violations until restrictions end. (1-5, 9-1-3g)

### 9.1.3 SITUATION L :

B1 illegally steps into the free-throw lane before A1's final free throw is released, (a) B1 then commits basket interference; or (b), A2 then steps into the free-throw lane prematurely and commits basket interference.

**RULING:** 
The first infraction by the defensive player B1 does not end the free throw and is a "delayed" free-throw violation; the ball is still live. In (a), the ball becomes dead when the basket interference occurs. Score the free throw for A1. Since the free throw is successful, the lane violation by B1 is ignored. Team B will have a throw-in from any point outside the end line. In (b), when A2 enters the free-throw lane prematurely, the violation is ignored, since B1 violated first. But when A2 commits basket interference, the ball becomes dead immediately and ends the free throw and no point can be scored. Therefore, the free throw is unsuccessful and A1 would be given a substitute throw. Play is resumed from the free-throw situation. (4-20-3, 6-7-9, 9-1-3g Penalty 2a, 9-1-3g Penalty 2b, 9-1-3g Penalty 4, 9-11 Penalty 1)

<!-- Page 70: Page 70 -->

DESIGNATED SPOT THROW-IN

### 9.2.1 SITUATION A :

A1 is out of bounds for a designated-spot throw-in. The administering official has designated the spot and put the ball at A1's disposal. In order to avoid some of the defensive pressure near the throw-in spot, A1 takes several steps (a) directly backward, prior to releasing the ball on a throw-in pass; or (b) to the left or right.

**RULING:** 
In (a), legal throw-in. It is permissible for the thrower to move backward or forward within the 3-foot-wide designated area without violating. In (b), A1 may move laterally if at least one foot is kept on or over the designated area until the ball is released, if not, a violation has occurred. The thrower may also jump vertically and pass from the designated throw-in spot.

**COMMENT:** 
Pivot-foot restrictions and the traveling rule are not in effect for a throw-in. The thrower must keep one foot on or over the spot until the ball is released. (4-42-6)

### 9.2.1 SITUATION B :

A1, out of bounds for a designated spot throw-in: (a) muffs the pass from the official and it rolls forward; or (b) after receiving the ball from the official, fumbles the ball and leaves the designated spot to retrieve the fumble.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the official should sound the whistle to prevent any violations and then start the throw-in procedure again. No throw-in violation should be ruled in this situation. In (b), a throw-in violation shall be ruled on A1 for leaving the designated spot. (4-42-6)
THROW-IN VIOLATIONS

### 9.2.2 SITUATION A :

Thrower A1: (a) causes the ball to carom from the wall behind that player, or from the floor out of bounds and then into the court; (b) caroms the ball from the back of the backboard to a player in the court; or (c) throws the ball against the side or the front face of the backboard, after which it rebounds into the hands of A2.
RULING
:
Violation in (a) and (b), since the throw touched an object out of bounds. The throw-in in (c) is legal. The side and front face of the backboard are inbounds and, in this specific situation, are treated the same as the floor inbounds.

### 9.2.2 SITUATION B :

On a designated spot throw-in by A1 in Team A's frontcourt, the ball is: (a) first touched in the court by A1; or (b) touched or caught by A2 whose hand(s) is on the out-of-bounds side of the throw-in boundary plane.

**RULING:** 
Throw-in violation in both (a) and (b), B's ball at the spot of the throw-in. (9-2-3, 9-2-6)

### 9.2.2 SITUATION C :

A1 scores a field goal. After the ball goes through the net, B1 grabs it and makes a move toward the end line as though preparing to make a throw-in. However, B1 never legally steps out of bounds, both feet remain inbounds. B1 immediately passes the ball up the court to a fast-breaking teammate, who scores a basket.
RULING
:
Cancel Team B's goal, throw-in violation on B1. The ball was at B1's disposal after the made basket to make a throw-in. B1 must be out of bounds to make a legal throw-in. (7-4-3, 7-5-7)

### 9.2.2 SITUATION D :

A1 bounces the ball on the floor on the out-of-bounds area before making a throw-in.

**RULING:** 
Legal, a player may bounce the ball on the out-of-bounds area prior to making a throw-in.

<!-- Page 71: Page 71 -->


### 9.2.5 SITUATION A :

Thrower A1 inadvertently steps onto the court inbounds. A1 immediately steps back into normal out-of-bounds throw-in position. The contact with the court occured (a) with; or (b) without defensive pressure on the throw-in team.
RULING
:
A violation in both (a) and (b).

**COMMENT:** 
Whether or not there was defensive pressure or whether or not stepping on the court was inadvertent, it is a violation and no judgment is required in making the call.

### 9.2.5 SITUATION B :

A1 has the ball out of bounds for a throw-in and is being guarded by B1. Before releasing the ball, A1 becomes off-balanced, reaches out and puts a hand on B1 (who is inbounds) in an effort to regain balance.

**RULING:** 
Throw-in violation by A1. A1 is required to remain out of bounds until releasing the throw-in pass. However, if the contact on B1 is illegal, a personal foul shall be called. This statement on A1's status is not supported by Rule 4-35 which defines status/location. (9-2-10 Note)
9.2.8 SITUATION:
Team A is awarded an alternating-possession throw-in in its frontcourt. A1 lobs the throw-in pass toward A2 who is breaking to the basket. The throw-in pass is too high and lodges between the ring and backboard.
RULING
:
Violation by A1 for lodging the untouched throw-in pass. Team B's ball at the throw-in spot. Since A1 violated during an alternating-possession throw-in, Team A has lost the arrow. Team B will have the arrow for the next alternating-possession throw-in. (6-4-5)
9.2.9 SITUATION:
Following a violation, the official has properly signaled and awarded a throw-in to Team A at a designated spot. No Team A player comes to the spot even though the official has allowed ample time for any Team A player to respond. The official then places the ball on the floor and begins the five-second count. (a) Both A1 and A2 step out of bounds and A1 picks up the ball; or (b) both A1 and A2 step out of bounds and A1 picks up the ball and hands it to A2.
RULING
:
In (a), A2 must immediately return inbounds. In (b), it is a throw-in violation when A1 hands the ball to A2.
BOUNDARY-PLANE infraction

### 9.2.10 SITUATION a :

A1 is out of bounds for a throw-in. B1 reaches through the boundary plane and knocks the ball out of A1's hands. Team B has not been warned previously for a throw-in plane infraction.
RULING
:
B1 is charged with a technical foul and it also results in the official having a team warning recorded and reported to the head coach.
COMMENT
:
In situations with the clock running and five or less seconds left in the game, a throw-in plane violation or interfering with the ball following a goal should be ignored if its only purpose is to stop the clock. However, if the tactic in any way interferes with the thrower's efforts to make a throw-in, a technical foul for delay shall be called even though no previous warning had been issued. In this situation, if the official stopped the clock and issued a team warning, it would allow the team to benefit from the tactic. (4-47-1; 10-2-1b, c; 10-2-10 NOTE 2; 10-4-10)

### 9.2.10 SITUATION B :

Team A has a (a) designated spot throw-in in its frontcourt, or (b) alternating-possession throw-in along the end line. Thrower A1 extends the ball with both arms over the end line such that part of the forearms,

<!-- Page 72: Page 72 -->

hands, and the ball are entirely on the inbounds side of the boundary line. B2 slaps A1 on the wrist and dislodges the ball.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), when a defender makes contact with a thrower-in, the result is an intentional foul. Where A1's arms are located (on the inbounds or out-of-bounds side of the boundary line) is immaterial. A1 is awarded two free throws and Team A awarded a throw-in at one of the two designated spots along the end line nearest to where the foul occurred. In (b), since the throw-in did not end, the arrow remains with Team A. (4-19-3e, 6-4-5, 7-5-3b, 9-2-10 Penalty 4)
PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS – LEAVING THE COURT

### 9.3.3 SITUATION A :

A1 receives a pass while in the restricted area of the three-second lane. A1 passes the ball to A2 outside the three-point line. In order to get the three-second count stopped, A1 steps directly out of bounds under A's basket.

**RULING:** 
A1 is charged with a violation for leaving the court to avoid a violation.

### 9.3.3 SITUATION B :

A1 and A2 set a double screen near the end line. A3 intentionally goes out of bounds outside the end line to have the defender (B3) detained by the double screen. (a) A3 receives a pass as soon as A3 re-enters the court from A4; (b) A3 does not receive a pass and play continues; (c) A4 continues to dribble the ball while B3 recovers defensively on A3. A3 continues to cut to get open and receives a pass from A4.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the official shall call a violation on A3 as soon as A3 touches the ball. The ball is awarded to Team B at one of the four designated spots relative to the three-point line where the violation occurred. In (b) and (c), no violation has occurred and play continues; In (c), any advantage that was gained by A3 going out of bounds was no longer in effect when A3 received the pass from A4.

### 9.3.3 SITUATION C :

A1 and A2 set a double screen near the end line. B3 intentionally goes out of bounds outside the end line to avoid being screened by A1 and A2. Just as B3 goes out of bounds, A3's try is in flight.

**RULING:** 
No violation for the defense leaving the court to avoid a screen.
THROUGH THE BASKET FROM BELOW
9.4 SITUATION:
At A's basket, the ball enters the net from below and passes through the basket: (a) The officials do not know whether a player of Team A or Team B was responsible; (b) the ball entered the basket after A1's pass was deflected by B1; or (c) A1 and B1 touched the ball simultaneously before it entered the basket.
RULING
:
The ball becomes dead when it enters from below and passes through. In (a) and (c), a throw-in will follow by the team entitled to it under the alternating-possession procedure. In (b), it is A's ball for a throw-in at one of the designated spots 3 feet outside the lane line along the end line nearest where the violation occurred, as B1 caused the violation.

<!-- Page 73: Page 73 -->

DRIBBLE RULE
9.5 SITUATION:
A1 dribbles and comes to a stop after which the player throws the ball against: (a) the team's own backboard; (b) the opponent's backboard; or (c) an official and catches the ball after each.

**RULING:** 
Legal in (a); a team's own backboard is considered a try for goal. In (b) and (c), A1 has violated; throwing the ball against an opponent's backboard or an official constitutes another dribble, provided A1 is first to touch the ball after it strikes the official or the board. (4-4-5, 4-15-1, 4-15-2, Fundamental 19)
9.5.1 SITUATION:
A1 ends a dribble and then jumps and releases the ball on a try for goal. B1 partially blocks the shot, but A1 secures control again while still in the air. A1 returns to the floor and dribbles to the basket and scores.
RULING
:
Legal maneuver. Both player control and team control ended when A1 released the ball. A1 recovered the ball and could dribble again similar to dribbling after catching a pass or rebound.
9.5.3 SITUATION:
A1 is dribbling in backcourt and ends the dribble, but defensive pressure prevents a pass to A2. A1 then passes the ball so it touches B1. A1 recovers the loose ball in backcourt and dribbles again.
RULING
:
No violation. When A1's pass was touched by, or touched, another player, A1 may start a new dribble. The 10-second backcourt count continues.
THREE-SECOND RULE
9.7.1 SITUATION:
A1 rebounds the ball off Team B's backboard. A2 is in Team A's three-second restricted area when the rebound occurs and A2 remains there while A1 is dribbling in Team A's backcourt. Three seconds expire without the ball being in the frontcourt of Team A.
RULING
:
This is not a violation. The three-­second lane restriction is not in effect until Team A is in control of the ball in Team A's frontcourt.
9.7.2 SITUATION:
A1 is standing with one foot inside and the other outside the three-second restricted area. A1 lifts the foot from the restricted area and returns it there without touching it first to the nonrestricted area.

**RULING:** 
Violation. This action does not terminate the three-second count. The count goes on since merely lifting the foot from the restricted space is interpreted as an attempt to evade the rule and avoid its purpose. However, there is no three-second count during rebounding action or during a throw-in. The count on a player in the restricted area is suspended when that player begins a try for goal.
TEN-SECOND RULE

### 9.8 SITUATION A :

A1 is in A's backcourt and has dribbled for nine seconds and then passes the ball forward towards A2 in the frontcourt. While the ball is in flight from backcourt to frontcourt, the 10-second count is reached.
RULING
:
Violation by Team A as the ball has not gained frontcourt location/status. It is B's ball for a throw-in from one of the four designated throw-in spots closest to where A1 released the ball on the pass toward A2.

**COMMENT:** 
Since Team B is

<!-- Page 74: Page 74 -->

gaining possession in its frontcourt, the throw-in will take place at one of the four designated spots. (4-4-3, 7-5-3a)

### 9.8 SITUATION B :

Team A has control of the ball for eight seconds in A's backcourt when A1 passes the ball toward Team A's frontcourt. The official's count continues. The ball strikes the floor in A's frontcourt and stays there without being touched by any player. Should the count continue after the ball touches in frontcourt?

**RULING:** 
No. The backcourt count should be terminated as soon as the ball has frontcourt location/status by touching the floor in Team A's frontcourt. (4-4-1, 4-4-2)

### 9.8 SITUATION C :

After A1 has dribbled for nine seconds in A's backcourt: (a) A1 requests a time-out; or (b) B1 deflects the ball out of bounds.
RULING
:
In both (a) and (b), Team A will have 10 seconds to advance the ball to frontcourt following the throw-in if a player of Team A gains control in A's backcourt.

### 9.8 SITUATION D :

Team A is in control in its backcourt for seven seconds. A1 throws the ball toward A2 in the frontcourt. B1 jumps from Team A's: (a) frontcourt; or (b) backcourt and while in the air bats the ball back to A1 in A's backcourt. Does this give Team A 10 more seconds to get the ball to the frontcourt?
RULING
:
Yes, in (a), a new count starts because B1 had frontcourt location/status when touching the ball thus giving the ball frontcourt location/status. In (b), the original count continues as Team A is still in control and the ball has not gained frontcourt status. (4-3, 4-4-2, 4-35-1)
FRONTCOURT – BACKCOURT

### 9.9.1 SITUATION A :

A1 catches the throw-in pass with one foot on the floor in A's frontcourt and the other foot not touching the floor. The non-pivot foot then comes down in A's backcourt.
RULING
:
Violation. Player and team control are established in A's frontcourt when A1 catches the throw-in pass. The violation occurs when A1 subsequently touches the backcourt with the non-pivot foot. (4-12-2a, 9-9-3)

### 9.9.1 SITUATION B :

During a jump ball, A1 taps the ball. A2 takes off from Team A's frontcourt and catches the ball while in the air. A2 lands with: (a) both feet in frontcourt and then steps to backcourt with one foot; (b) one foot in backcourt and one in the frontcourt; (c) both feet in the backcourt; or (d) one foot in the frontcourt and then steps with the other foot into the backcourt.
RULING
:
Team control is not established until A2 catches the ball. Violation in (a). Legal in (b), (c) and (d). (4-12-6, 9-9-3)

### 9.9.1 SITUATION C :

A1 is dribbling in Team A's backcourt and throws a pass to the frontcourt. While standing in A's frontcourt: (a) A2 or (b) B3 touches the ball and deflects it back to A's backcourt where it touches the floor. A2 recovers in the backcourt.
RULING
:
In (a), it is a violation. The ball was in control of A1 and Team A, and a player from A was the last to touch the ball in frontcourt and a player of A was the first to touch it after it returned to the back court. In (b), legal play. A Team A player was not the last to touch the ball in the frontcourt. Team A is entitled to a new 10-second count.

<!-- Page 75: Page 75 -->


### 9.9.1 SITUATION D :

Team A is awarded a throw-in near the division line. A1's throw-in is deflected by B1; A2 jumps from Team A's frontcourt, catches the ball in the air and lands in the backcourt.

**RULING:** 
Backcourt violation on Team A. The throw-in ends when it is legally touched by B1. A2 gains player and team control in the air after having left the floor from Team A's frontcourt, therefore having frontcourt location/status. As soon as A2 lands in the backcourt, a backcourt violation has been committed. The exception granted during a throw-in ends when the throw-in ends and is only for the player making the initial touch on the ball. (9-9-3)

### 9.9.1 SITUATION E :

A1 inbounds the ball at the division line; A2 jumps from the frontcourt, controls the ball in the air, and while still in the air passes it to A3, who is in the backcourt.

**RULING:** 
Backcourt violation.

**COMMENT:** 
The throw-in exception only applies to the player initially receiving the throw-in pass (first touch). Since the throw-in has ended, all backcourt rules apply. Had A2 just landed in the backcourt, there would have been no violation. (9-9-3, 4-42-5)

### 9.9.1 SITUATION F :

A1 is holding, dribbling or passing the ball near the division line in the frontcourt. B1 deflects the ball into the air in the backcourt. Prior to the ball touching the floor in the backcourt, the ball is (a) caught by (b) touched by (c) touches A2 who has backcourt location/status (or is located in the backcourt).
RULING
:
Legal in a, b and c. (9-9-1 Exception)

### 9.9.1 SITUATION G :

Team A is making a throw-in from the end line in itsfrontcourt.
A1
throws a high-arching pass toward the division line.
B1, in the frontcourt, tips the ball. A2, also in the frontcourt, then tips the ball from the frontcourt into the backcourt. Player A2 then gains control of the ball.

**RULING:** 
Although there is team control on a throw-in, it only pertains to foul situations (4.19.7).
Both B1 and A2 touched the ball, but touching the ball does not establish team control inbounds.
Though the ball was touched last by the offense in the frontcourt, there was no violation by Team A since team control had not yet been established in Team A’s frontcourt before the ball went into Team A’s backcourt.

### 9.9.1 SITUATION H :

A1 holding the ball in the frontcourt. A1 steps (a) on, but not over, the division line; or b) into the backcourt.

**RULING:** 
This is a backcourt violation. The ball will be awarded to Team B in its frontcourt at the 28-foot mark closest to where the violation occurred.
FRONTCOURT CLOSELY-GUARDED ACTION

### 9.10.1 SITUATION A :

While closely guarded, A1 dribbles across the division line and while in A's frontcourt: (a) dribbles for five seconds; or (b) dribbles for three seconds and then holds the ball for four seconds before passing the ball to A2.
RULING
:
Violation in (a) and Team B's ball because the five-second count was reached during the dribble in the frontcourt. Legal action in (b).

**COMMENT:** 
State associations adopting the 35-second shot clock, may allow a player to be closely guarded while dribbling without penalty. (4-10 EXCEPTION, 9-10-1a NOTE)

<!-- Page 76: Page 76 -->


### 9.10.1 SITUATION B :

While dribbling in A's frontcourt, A1 is closely guarded by B1. After two seconds, B2 also assumes a closely-guarded position on A1 and B1 leaves to guard A2.

**RULING:** 
The closely-guarded count continues. There is no requirement for the defensive player to remain the same during the count as long as A1 is closely-guarded throughout.

**COMMENT:** 
State associations adopting the 35-second shot clock, may allow a player to be closely guarded while dribbling without penalty. (4-10 EXCEPTION, 9-10-1a NOTE)

### 9.10.1 SITUATION C :

Team A, while in control of the ball in its frontcourt: (a) positions four players parallel with the sideline and they pass the ball from one to another with their arms reaching beyond the sideline plane; or (b) has four teammates surround dribbler A1. In both (a) and (b), the opponents are unable to get close to the ball.
RULING
:
This is considered to be a closely-guarded situation and a violation in five seconds in both (a) and (b), if any B player is within 6 feet of the ball or within 6 feet of the screening teammates and is attempting to gain control of the ball. Preventing opponents from getting to the ball by using screening teammates becomes a violation in five seconds if the opponents are attempting to gain control.

**COMMENT:** 
State associations adopting the 35-second shot clock, may allow a player to be closely guarded while dribbling without penalty. (4-10 EXCEPTION, 9-10-1a NOTE)
9.10.3 SITUATION:
Dribbler A1 is closely-guarded by B1 in A's frontcourt and the covering official's count is at three when A1's dribble is interrupted when the ball bounces off A1's foot. An additional two seconds goes by as A1 turns to get the loose ball and B1 remains within 6 feet.
RULING
:
The closely-guarded count shall be terminated when the dribble is interrupted, but it will start over if A1 continues the dribble or holds the ball and is again closely-guarded.

**COMMENT:** 
State associations adopting the 35-second shot clock, may allow a player to be closely guarded while dribbling without penalty. (9-10-1a NOTE)
BASKET INTERFERENCE
9.11 SITUATION:
Both A1 and B1 jump to grab a rebound at the basket of Team A. Each has a hand on the ball which is entirely outside of the cylinder above the basket. While both have contact with the ball, it is carried or forced into the cylinder above the basket.
RULING
:
There is no violation by either player for having hand(s) on the ball while it is in the cylinder or basket in this situation. (4-6-2 Exception)

### 9.11.1 SITUATION A :

A1 taps the ball toward Team A's basket. While the ball is in the cylinder above the basket or on the basket ring: (a) B1 touches the ball; or (b) A2 touches the ball.
RULING
:
In (a), basket interference by B1 causes the ball to become dead and the official shall award Team A two points. In (b), the basket interference by A2 causes the ball to become dead. No basket. The ball is awarded to Team B at one of the two designated throw-in spots along the end line. (4-6, 6-7-9)

### 9.11.1 SITUATION B :

While the ball is touching the ring of the basket on a field-goal attempt by A1, B1 grasps the ring when there is no threat of injury.
RULING
:
This is a double infraction and both acts are penalized. It is both basket interference

<!-- Page 77: Page 77 -->

and a technical foul. The moment the hand touched the ring, it was basket interference. When the player grasped the ring, a technical foul occurred. Award two points to Team A, followed by two free throws and a division line throw-in. (10-4-3)

### 9.11.1 SITUATION C :

The ball is in flight during a three-point field-goal try by A1 when time for a quarter expires. Following the expiration of time and while the ball is rolling on the ring, B1 tips it into the basket.

**RULING:** 
Violation by B1. The ball was live until the violation, it then became dead. The field goal does not count. However, the action by B1 is basket interference. Three points are awarded to A1 because of the basket interference by B1 during a three-point try. (4-6, 6-7-9)

### 9.11.1 SITUATION D :

The ball is on the ring of Team A's basket when A1 hits the net.
RULING
:
Legal play. If the touching the basket involved contact with the net only, the official must determine if the contact had an effect on the ball which would rise to the level of basket interference. (4-6-1 EXCEPTION)

### 9.11.1 SITUATION e :

The ball is touching the side of the basket ring of Team A. B1 jumps and B1's hand contacts the net. The ball definitely is not touching the top of the basket ring.
RULING
:
This is not a violation. The ball remains live. (4-6-1)

### 9.11.2 SITUATION A :

A1 tries for a field goal. B1 rebounds, but A2 slaps the ball from the grasp of B1. The ball is above the level of the basket and is partly in the cylinder when B2 slaps the ball away to teammate B3.
RULING
:
Basket interference by B2. Two points for Team A. The throw-in by B may be from anywhere out of bounds along the end line. (4-6, 6-7-9, 7-4-3, 7-5-7)

### 9.11.2 SITUATION B :

A1 shoots the ball and it enters the basket from above, but from outside the cylinder. A1's hand loses contact with the ball before the ball enters the cylinder. However, on the follow-through, A1's hand enters the cylinder and again contacts the ball.
RULING
:
Violation. It is not a violation for a player to have a hand within the cylinder above the basket provided it is not touching the ball. The rules do allow a player to carry the ball into the cylinder above the ring or place the ball into the basket itself. It is basket interference; however, when a player touches the ball or the basket when the ball is in or on the basket, or touches the ball while any portion of the ball is touching the cylinder directly above the basket and the player did not carry the ball into the cylinder or basket. (4-6)

### 9.11.2 SITUATION C :

Since it is a violation for thrower A1 to throw the ball directly into the basket from out of bounds, what happens if B1 touches the throw-in pass while the ball is in the cylinder above A's basket?
RULING
:
B1 is charged with basket interference and a two-point goal is scored even if the throw-in is from outside the three-point line. Team B is awarded the ball for a throw-in anywhere along the end lines as after a scored goal except the official shall place the ball at the disposal of a player of Team B for a throw-in from any point outside the end line. (4-6, 7-4-3, 7-5-7)

### 9.11.2 SITUATION D :

After A1's free-throw attempt strikes the ring and rebounds in the cylinder above the basket: (a) A2; or (b) B1 touches the ball.
RULING
:
Basket interference in both (a) and (b). No point in (a). In (b), the free throw is scored because of the basket interference. (9-11 Penalty 1, 9-11 Penalty 2)

<!-- Page 78: Page 78 -->

9.11.2
SITUATION E:
A1 is fouled in the act of shooting a two-point field goal by B1. While the ball is in the cylinder above the basket, A2 touches the ball.

**RULING:** 
The basket interference by A2 causes the ball to become dead and no goal can be scored. A1 is awarded two free throws and players occupy spaces and play continues when the last free throw is made or missed.
9.11.4 SITUATION:
Defender B4 attempts to stop an apparent lob pass. While B4 is airborne, A3 moves beneath B4. To avoid injury, B4 grasps the basket ring. While B4 grasps the ring, A1 shoots from about 12 feet away. Just after A1 releases the shot, B4 lets go of the ring and lands safely. The ring is still moving when (a) the ball hits the moving ring and bounces out; (b) the ball, despite the moving ring, enters and passes completely through the basket; or (c) the ring stops vibrating (returns to its normal position) and the ball bounces off the ring.

**RULING:** 
Since B4 grasped the ring to prevent injury, no technical foul is ruled. However, the basket interference rule applies. In (a), basket interference is ruled on B4 because the ball struck a still-vibrating ring. Award A1 two points. In (b), since the ball entered and passed completely through the basket, basket interference is not ruled. Play continues. In (c), because the ring returned to its original position before the ball struck the ring, basket interference is not called. Play continues. (4-6-4, 10-4-3)
GOALTENDING

### 9.12 SITUATION A :

On the first free throw by A1 in a bonus SITUATION: B1 leaps above the free-throw lane and touches the ball but it falls in the basket anyway.
RULING
:
Delayed lane violation on B1; the ball is still live. During a free throw attempt, the ball does not need to be on its downward flight or above ring level for goaltending to occur. If a free throw is interfered with before the ball reaches the ring, it is a violation. The goaltending violation causes an immediate dead ball and an automatic point for A1; B1 is assessed a technical foul. A1 is awarded the bonus free throw. Following the free throws for the technical foul, it is A's ball for a division line throw-in opposite the table. (4-22, 6-7-9, 10-4-9)

### 9.12 SITUATION B :

B1 touches A1's try for field goal: (a) just after its release and while the ball is still in upward flight; or (b) while the ball is in downward flight outside the cylinder and above ring level and has the possibility of entering the basket.
RULING
:
In (a), the legal touching does not end the try and the ball remains live. In (b), the defensive goaltending causes the ball to become dead immediately and two points are awarded to Team A. (4-22, 6-7-9)

### 9.12 SITUATION C :

On the second of two free-throw attempts by A1, the ball is on its upward flight just after the try is released, when the ball is touched outside the cylinder by B2.

**RULING:** 
B2 has committed a goaltending violation and Team A is awarded one point. B2 is also assessed a technical foul. Team A will be given two free throws. Following the free throws Team A will be awarded the ball for a designated spot throw-in at the division line opposite the table. (9-1 PENALTY 1, 10-4-9)

<!-- Page 79: Page 79 -->

SWINGING ARm(S) OR ELBOw(S)
9.13.1
SITUATION A:
The ball has been released on a try or tap for field goal by A1 towards A's basket: (a) A2, or (b) B1, excessively swings arm(s) or elbow(s) without contacting an opponent. The ball goes through the basket.

**RULING:** 
In (a), the official will sound the whistle immediately for a violation. The ball is dead, the goal is not scored and Team B is awarded a throw-in at the spot closest to the violation. In (b), the ball is dead when the try ends. The goal is scored and Team A is awarded a throw-in at one of the four designated throw-in spots based on the location of the violation relative to the three-point line. (6-7-9 Exception d, 7-5-3a)
9.13.1
SITUATION B:
A1 is trapped in the corner by B1 and B2 in Team A's backcourt, who are in legal guarding position. In an attempt to create space, A1 rapidly swings arms/elbows while using the shoulders as pivots (a) without making contact; (b) making contact with an opponent above the shoulders and elbows are moving faster than the body.
RULING
:
In (a), A1 excessively swinging arms/elbows without contacting the opponent is a violation. Team B is awarded a throw-in at one of the four designated spots based on the location of the violation relative to the three-point line. In (b), this is considered an intentional foul.

**COMMENT:** 
In (a), Team B will gain possession in its frontcourt and therefore inbound the ball from one of the four designated spots based on the location of the violation relative to the three-point line.
9.13.2 SITUATION:
A5 catches the ball on a rebound, “chins” the ball and then turns (with the elbow at the same speed as the body) to make an outlet pass with the elbow leading the way. Prior to releasing the ball, A1’s elbow contacts B5 above the shoulders.
RULING
:
Depending on whether or not the contact displaces or inhibits the defensive player, this
may be ruled incidental contact or a player control foul.

# Rule 10 – Fouls and Penalties

TEAM TECHNICALS
10.1.1 PEN SITUATION:
The scorer notifies an official five minutes before the scheduled start time that two starters for Team A have the same number listed in the scorebook. With two minutes left in pregame a teammate from Team B dunks the ball. While the teams are heading to their benches, with seconds left in pregame, A1 and B1 exchange taunting language.

**RULING:** 
Team A will be charged with two technical fouls to count toward the bonus. One technical is for the administrative technical as a result of the scorebook issue and the second technical is for A1's taunting. The taunting is charged to A1 and counts as one of their five for disqualification. Team B will be charged with two technical fouls to count toward the bonus. One technical is for Team B dunking and the second technical is for B1's taunting. The taunting is charged to B1 and counts as one of their five for disqualification. Both head coaches are charged with an indirect technical because of the unsporting

<!-- Page 80: Page 80 -->

technical fouls charged to A1 and B1 and both lose the privilege of the coaching box. All free throws offset. The game will start with a jump ball.

**COMMENT:** 
When pregame administrative, team and/or bench technical fouls occur by each team in equal numbers, they offset. Each team will begin the game with two team technical fouls. No free throws are shot and both coaches lose the privilege of the coaching box, however because A1 and B1 received unsporting technical fouls for taunting, both players will be charged with a foul that counts toward their five for disqualification and thus both head coaches are charged "indirectly" for those technical fouls, and both lose the privilege of the coaching box. [10-1-1 PENALTY, 10-1-2 PENALTY, 10-2-7 PENALTY (NEW), 10-4-6c, 10-5-1 PENALTY (NEW)]
10.1.2 SITUATION:
(a) Three minutes prior to the start of the game; or (b) during a time-out in the second quarter of play, the Team B coach requests the scorer to add a name to the team list or change a team member's number in the scorebook. When is the penalty invoked for this administrative infraction?

**RULING:** 
The infraction occurs when the scorer is advised to add to or change the scorebook. The foul must be charged when it occurs and enforced when the ball next becomes live. Once the ball has become live, it is too late to penalize.
10.1.3 SITUATION:
The home team: (a) has a television monitor in the press box or the dressing room and is relaying information to the player's bench; or (b) uses a replay of the first half during the intermission for use by the coach in preparation for the second half.
RULING
:
Legal in both (a) and (b).

**COMMENT:** 
Electronic devices may be used on the player bench for coaching and statistical purposes only. Video may not be used to review an official's decision. (1-19)

### 10.2.1 SITUATION A :

A1 is fouled by B1 during an unsuccessful try and is awarded two free throws. Team B requests and is granted a charged 60-second time-out. Team B disregards the 15-second warning signal and the signal ending the time-out and is still huddling with their coach at the end of the charged time-out.
RULING
:
The official shall administer the first free throw using the resumption-of-play procedure and a violation occurs if it is missed. If two B players are not in the required position when the official is ready to put the ball in play for the substitute throw, a delay of game technical foul will be assessed. If the first attempt is good, the same procedure is used for the second. (9-1-2, 10-2-5)

### 10.2.1 SITUATION B :

The ruling official has reported the foul and is ready to administer the free throw. Free thrower A1 is: (a) huddling with teammates by the team bench area; or (b) is in the semicircle, but teammates are huddling in the free-throw lane area.
RULING
:
A technical foul for delay by A1 in (a). In (b), Team A is warned for delay. In (b), if Team A had been warned previously for any delay-of-game situation, a team technical foul would be charged. (10-2-5, 10-4-5c)

### 10.2.1 SITUATION C :

The ruling official has reported the foul and proceeds to the proper position for the first of two free throws awarded to A1. B1 and B2 are: (a) huddling in the free-throw lane; or (b) two B players are not occupying the first two marked spaces next to the end line as required.
RULING
:
In (a), if the huddle delays

<!-- Page 81: Page 81 -->

the officials' administration, Team B is warned. The warning is recorded by the scorer and reported to the head coach. If Team B had been previously warned for delay, a technical foul shall be charged. In (b), Team B will be directed to occupy the required spaces. If there is delay, a team technical foul shall be charged to Team B. (4-47)

### 10.2.1 SITUATION D :

Immediately following a goal by A1, A3 slaps the ball away so that Team B is unable to make a quick throw-in.
RULING
:
The official shall sound a whistle and go to the table to have the scorer record a team warning for delay. The warning shall then be reported to the head coach of Team A. Any subsequent delay by Team A shall result in a team technical foul charged to Team A. (4-47-3)

### 10.2.1 SITUATION E :

Team B is warned in the first half when B1 reaches through the inbounds side of the throw-in boundary plane. Early in the fourth quarter: (a) B1; or (b) B2 does the same thing.

**RULING:** 
The technical foul in both (a) and (b) is charged to Team B. A team will only receive one of the four delay-of-game warnings during a game. Thereafter, any delay-of-game situation by a member of that same team results in a technical foul. (9-2-10)
SIX IN GAME
10.2.2 SITUATION:
With Team A leading 51 to 50, a held ball is ruled. A6 properly reports and enters the game. A time-out request is granted to Team B. The clock shows two seconds remaining in the game. After play is resumed by a throw-in, the officials: (a) recognize that A has six players competing, but cannot get the clock stopped; or (b) do not notice Team A has six players on the court. Following the throw-in, time expires. Team B now reports to the officials that Team A had six players on the court.
RULING
:
In (a), since one of the officials had knowledge that Team A had six players participating simultaneously and this was detected prior to time expiring, a technical foul is assessed against Team A. In (b), since it was not recognized by any official, but was called to their attention after time had expired, it is too late to assess any penalty.
EXCESS TIME-OUT
10.2.3 SITUATION:
A1 requests and Team A is granted a time-out late in the fourth quarter. Team A had already used its three 60-second time-outs and its two 30-second time-outs.
RULING
:
Team A is granted the time-out and is charged with a technical foul. No indirect foul is charged to the head coach.
A SPECIFIC UNSPORTING ACT
10.2.4 SITUATION:
Immediately following a goal or free throw by Team A, A1 inbounds the ball to A2 and A2 subsequently throws the ball through A's basket.

**RULING:** 
The following procedure has been adopted to handle this specific situation if it is recognized before the opponents gain control or before the next throw-in begins: (a) charge Team A with an unsporting technical foul; (b) assess a delay-of-game warning for interfering with the ball after a goal; (c) cancel the field goal; (d) cancel any common foul(s) committed and any non-flagrant foul against A2 in the act of shooting;

<!-- Page 82: Page 82 -->

and (e) put "consumed" time back on the clock.

**COMMENT:** 
If there is no doubt the throw-in was a result of confusion, the entire procedure would be followed except no unsporting team technical foul would be charged. A team technical would be assessed if the team had received a previous delay warning. This procedure shall not be used in any other throw-in situation in which an official administers the throw-in and a mistake allows the wrong team to inbound the ball. (4-47-3, 7-6-6, 10-2-1b)
DELAYING RETURN following time-out
10.2.5 SITUATION:
Following a charged time-out Team B players are still with their coach on the sideline when the official sounds the whistle to indicate play will resume. Four players of B return to the court just in time to play defense as A1 attempts an unsuccessful three-pointer. B1 rebounds and throws a long pass to B5 who enters the court just in time to catch the pass.

**RULING:** 
A technical foul is immediately charged to Team B for failing to have all players return to the court following a time-out or intermission. While it is true the entire team may be off the court while the procedure is being used, once a team responds, all players must enter the court at approximately the same time.
DUNKING/ATTEMPTING TO DUNK A DEAD BALL
10.2.7 SITUATION:
Fifteen minutes before the game is scheduled to start, team member A1 dunks. Two minutes later A2 dunks.
RULING
:
Two team technical fouls are assessed and counted as team fouls for purpose of reaching the bonus.

**COMMENT:** 
When dunking occurs during the pregame practice period the official notifies the team member and the head coach, but does not sound the whistle.
Team B will shoot two free throws for each technical foul (four total) and start the game with a throw-in from the division line. (10-2-7 PENALTY)
NOT REPORTING – NOT BEING BECKONED

### 10.3.1 SITUATION A :

Substitute A1 enters the court without reporting to the scorer. The infraction is discovered: (a) before the ball becomes live; or (b) after the ball becomes live.
RULING
:
In (a), a technical foul is charged to A1. In (b), it is too late to penalize A1.

### 10.3.1 SITUATION B :

Team A substitute No. 24: (a) reports to the scorer, but enters the court without being beckoned; or (b) goes directly from the bench and onto the court without being beckoned.
RULING
:
One technical foul is charged to No. 24 in (a) and (b). In (b), even though No. 24 failed to comply with both requirements, only one foul is charged.
10.3.2 SITUATION:
During a live ball and with the clock running, substitute A6 enters the court.
RULING
:
A technical foul is charged if recognized by an official before the ball becomes live following the first dead ball.

<!-- Page 83: Page 83 -->

Blood – Uniform Jersey Change(s)
10.4.1 SITUATION:
A1 is directed to leave the game because of blood on A1's uniform jersey. The jersey cannot be cleaned immediately. Team A requests and is granted a time-out. A1 leaves the visual confines of the playing court and changes to a different jersey. The number change is reported to an official and the scorer and is recorded in the score book. (a) A1 completes the jersey change and the new number is recorded within the limits of the time-out; (b) A1's original jersey is cleaned during halftime. A1 changes back into A1's original jersey and reports the change to an official and the scorer.
RULING
:
(a) Legal. There is no penalty. A1 may remain in the game. (b) Legal. There is no penalty. A1 may enter the game wearing the original jersey.

**COMMENT:** 
All potential confusion has been eliminated through the official reporting and recording of the jersey number changes and the referee informing the opposing team. (2-3)
delay returning to court
10.4.2
SITUATION A:
A1 has the ball out of bounds for a throw-in. A1 completes the throw-in to A2 and then purposefully delays returning by taking four or five steps along the end line prior to coming inbounds behind a screen set by A3 and A4. A1 gets a return pass from A2 and takes an unchallenged try for goal.

**RULING:** 
Team A is charged with a violation for
purposefully delaying returning to the court
, and being the first to touch the ball,
following the throw-in. A1's movement out of bounds along the end line was to take advantage of the screen and return to the court in a more advantageous position.
10.4.2
SITUATION B:
After a lengthy substitution process involving multiple substitutions for both Team A and Team B, A5 goes to the bench and remains there, mistakenly believing a replacement has been made. The ball is put in play even though Team A has only four players on the court. Team A is bringing the ball into A's frontcourt when the coach of Team A realizes they have only four players. The coach yells for A5 to return and the player sprints directly onto the court and catches up with the play.

**RULING:** 
Team A is charged with a team technical for failing to have all players return to the court at approximately the same time. (10-2-5)
HANGING ON THE RING
10.4.3
SITUATION A:
A1 is dribbling rapidly toward A's basket and appears to have an uncontested opportunity to score. B1 comes in quickly from the side and violently undercuts A1 who is in the act of shooting. A1 momentarily hangs on the ring to regain balance and avoid injury.
RULING
:
A1 is not penalized for hanging
the ring, as it clearly was done to prevent possible injury. B1 is charged with a flagrant personal foul and is disqualified. Whether the try was successful or not, A1 is awarded two free throws with no players along the free-throw lane spaces. Following the last throw, Team A is awarded the ball for a throw-in at one of the four designated throw-in spots based on the location of the foul relative to the three-point line.

<!-- Page 84: Page 84 -->


### 10.4.3 SITUATION B :

A1 jumps for a try near the basket but becomes off-balanced after releasing the ball. A1 hangs on the ring to prevent injury. The ball: (a) is; or (b) is not, in the basket or on the ring while A1 is hanging on the ring.

**RULING:** 
In (a), it is basket interference by A1 which causes the ball to become dead and no goal can be scored. In (b), there is no violation unless A1 is still hanging on the ring when the ball touches the basket or goes into the basket. In both (a) and (b), A1's hanging on the ring is not penalized if it is judged there was a possibility of injury had the player not hung on the ring. (9-11)

### 10.4.3 SITUATION C :

A1 dunks the ball, then hangs on the ring: (a) to avoid possible injury as the player has lost balance; or (b) because A2 or B1 is lying on the floor directly under the basket.
RULING
:
Hanging on the ring to prevent injury as in (a) or (b), is permitted without penalty.
CONTACTING THE BACKBOARD
10.4.4 SITUATION:
A1 tries for a goal, and (a) B1 jumps and attempts to block the shot but instead slaps or strikes the backboard and the ball goes into the basket; or (b) B1 vibrates the ring as a result of pulling on the net and the ball does not enter the basket.
RULING
:
In (a) legal and the goal counts; and (b) a technical foul is charged to B1 and there is no goal.

**COMMENT:** 
The purpose of the rule is to penalize intentional contact with the backboard while a shot or try for goal is involved or placing a hand on the backboard to gain an advantage. A player who strikes either backboard so forcefully it cannot be ignored because it is an attempt to draw attention to the player, or a means of venting frustration may be assessed a technical foul pursuant to Rule 10-4-4.
DELAY BY FREE THROWER
10.4.5 SITUATION:
The ruling official has reported the foul and has given directions to players along the free-throw lane. The official is ready to put the ball at free thrower A1's disposal, but A1 is at the sideline talking to the coach.
RULING
:
A technical foul for delay is charged to A1. No warning is authorized in this situation. (10-4-5c)
unsporting fouls

### 10.4.6 SITUATION A :

Does holding or moving a hand or hands in front of the face of a player who has the ball, by an opponent who is in a legal guarding position, constitute unsporting tactics?
RULING
:
Yes. The described action is illegal. It is unsporting for a guard to take a position behind a post player, or to take a position facing an opponent, or to take a position with the guard's back to the ball and facing the opponent and then in either case, wave or hold the hands in front of the opponent's eyes so that the opponent cannot see. Holding or waving hands near the eye for the ostensible purpose of obstructing an opponent's vision is unsporting. (10-4-6c, d)

<!-- Page 85: Page 85 -->


### 10.4.6 SITUATION B :

A1 has the ball out of bounds for a designated spot throw-in. B1 is putting great pressure on and the count is at four seconds when A1 throws the ball and it strikes B1's face. The ball rebounds from B1's face directly out of bounds.

**RULING:** 
The administering official will have to make a decision based upon a number of observations. Was the throw-in to B1's face purely accidental or was it a voluntary, planned act? Was the ball contact caused by the movement of the defender? Was the act of a an unsporting nature? The administering official must be aware that players often react negatively in situations where players are frustrated or are retaliating for something which happened earlier in the game.

### 10.4.6 SITUATION C :

With 4 minutes remaining in the second quarter, B1 commits B1's third foul against airborne shooter A1; the try is unsuccessful. Team B's coach sends B6 to the scorer's table to replace B1 after A1's first free-throw. B1's replacement may not enter the game until after A1's first free throw. B1, disgusted with the official's ruling and realizing the player will soon leave the game, goes and sits on the end of Team B's bench just after the official reports the foul.

**RULING:** 
B1 is assessed an unsporting technical foul for leaving the court for an unauthorized reason to demonstrate disgust. A1 will attempt the two shooting-foul free throws followed by any Team A member attempting the two free throws for the technical foul. (3-3-3, 10-4-6i)
TECHNICAL FOUL CONTACT
10.4.7 SITUATION:
B1 fouls A1 during an unsuccessful try. While the ruling official is reporting the foul, A1 pushes B1 into another player.
RULING
:
Intentional contact while the ball is dead constitutes an intentional technical foul. If other dead-ball contact is not intentional or flagrant, it should be ignored. The foul by A1 creates a false double-foul situation.
THROW-IN FOULS

### 10.4.10 SITUATION A :

After a field goal, A1 has the ball out of bounds for a throw-in. Thrower A1 holds the ball: (a) B2 crosses the boundary line and fouls A1; or (b) B2 reaches through the out-of-bounds plane and touches the ball while in the hands of A1.
RULING
:
It is an intentional personal foul in (a), and a technical foul in (b). In (a), such a contact foul with the thrower during a throw-in shall be considered intentional, or if it is violent, it should be ruled flagrant.

**COMMENT:** 
Either act is a foul and it should be ruled as such whenever it occurs during a game without regard to time or score or whether the team had or had not been warned for a delay-of-game situation. If the player making the throw-in (A1) reaches through the out-of-bounds plane into the court and B1 then slaps the ball from the hand of A1, no violation has occurred. B1 has merely slapped a live ball from the hands of A1. (4-19-3, 4-19-4, 9-2-10 Penalty 3, 9-2-10 Penalty 4)

<!-- Page 86: Page 86 -->


### 10.4.10 SITUATION B :

After a field goal, the score is A-55, B-54. A1 has the ball out of bounds for a throw-in with two seconds remaining in the game. A1 throws the ball toward A2 who also is out of bounds along the end line. B2 reaches across the end line and grabs or slaps the ball while it is in flight. Time expires close to the moment the official indicates the infraction.

**RULING:** 
A technical foul is charged against B2. The remaining time or whether Team B had been previously warned for a delay-of-game situation is not a factor. No free throws are awarded as the winner of the game has been determined. (9-2-10 Penalty 3, 9-2-10 Penalty 4)

### 10.4.10 SITUATION C :

Team A scores near the end of the fourth quarter and is trailing by one point. B1 has the ball and is moving along the end line to make the throw-in. A2 steps out of bounds and fouls B1. Is the foul personal or technical?
RULING
:
This is an intentional personal foul. The time remaining to be played or whether Team A had been previously warned for a delay-of-game situation is not a factor. If the team had not been warned, the foul constitutes the warning. (4-19-3e, 9-2-10 Penalty 4)

### 10.4.10 SITUATION D :

A1 is out of bounds for a throw-in. B1 reaches through the boundary plane and knocks the ball out of A1's hands. Earlier in the game, Team B had received a team warning for delay.

**RULING:** 
Even though Team B had already been issued a warning for team delay, when B1breaks the plane and subsequently contacts the ball in the thrower's hand, it is considered all the same act and the end result is penalized. A player technical foul is assessed to B1; two free throws and a division line throw-in for Team A will follow. The previous warning for team delay still applies with any subsequent team delay resulting in a team technical foul. (4-47, 9-2-10 Penalty 3, 10-2-1c)
EJECTION
10.5 SITUATION:
(a) The head coach is charged (directly or indirectly) with a third technical foul, or a second direct technical; or (b) A1 commits a flagrant technical foul against B1.
RULING
:
In (a), the coach shall leave the vicinity or the playing area and have no further contact with the team. The official has no option and may not set aside the provision which requires removal. This also applies to all adult bench personnel who receive two technical fouls. In (b), the flagrant technical foul disqualifies A1 from further participation in the contest. A disqualified team member or student bench personnel shall go to or remain on the bench. However, in an unusual situation, an official has the authority to require that these individuals who have committed a flagrant technical foul must leave the vicinity of the court. This action is necessary when permitting such offenders to remain at courtside would tend to incite the crowd, to incite the opponents, or to subject the officials, opponents or others administering the game, to unsporting harassment. In such circumstances, the official should require the individual who has committed a flagrant foul to leave the vicinity of the court with an adult supervisor. It must be emphasized that an official does have this authority, when the circumstances resulting from any flagrant foul warrant it. (10-5 Penalty Note)

<!-- Page 87: Page 87 -->

BENCH TECHNICALS

### 10.5.1 SITUATION A :

A technical foul is charged to: (a) a Team A substitute; (b) Team B's manager; (c) Team A's athletic trainer; or (d) Team B's assistant coach. In all cases, the foul is charged because of uncomplimentary remarks addressed to an official.
RULING
:
The individuals in (a), (b), (c) and (d) are all considered to be bench personnel and have violated the rules governing conduct while on the "bench." A second technical charged to any of these individuals results in disqualification. In addition to charging a technical to the individuals in all cases, the technical foul is also charged indirectly to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. A second technical foul charged directly, or the third technical foul (direct or indirect) charged to the head coach results in similar disqualification and ejection. (10-5-1a)

### 10.5.1 SITUATION B :

At halftime, as the teams, coaches and officials are making their way through a hallway to the dressing room, a Team A member inappropriately addresses one of the officials.

**RULING:** 
The official must decide if the offense is major. Under 4-48, if not deemed to be major and neither a warning nor technical has been charged (direct or indirect) to the head coach, the bench personnel could be issued a warning. If a warning is issued, this would be reported to both teams, recorded in the scorebook, and the head coach would not lose coaching-box privileges. If the offense was judged to be major or a warning or technical has already been issued to the head coach, a technical foul is charged to the team member and is also charged indirectly to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. The third quarter will begin with two Team B free throws and the ball awarded at the division line for a throw-in. The alternating-possession arrow is unaffected. Team A will also have one foul toward the team-foul count. During intermission, all team members are bench personnel and are penalized accordingly. If the conduct is flagrant, the team member shall be disqualified. (4-48, 10-5-1a)

### 10.5.1 SITUATION C :

After the signal to end the first half, A1 removes the jersey near the team bench.

**RULING:** 
A technical foul is charged to A1 and an indirect technical foul is charged to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges; A1 is considered bench personnel in this situation. (10-5-1h)

### 10.5.1 SITUATION D :

A1 commits a fifth foul and is disqualified. On the way to the team bench, A1 removes the jersey or pulls it over the face: (a) before the coach is notified; or (b) after the coach is notified.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), a technical foul is charged to A1. In (b), an indirect technical foul is also charged to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. A1 is considered to be bench personnel. (10-5-1h)
WITHHOLD WHISTLE

### 10.5.1 SITUATION F :

A1 is driving toward the basket for an apparent goal when the official, while trailing the play advancing in the direction in which the ball is being advanced, is cursed by the head coach or bench personnel of Team B.

<!-- Page 88: Page 88 -->

How should the official handle this situation?
RULING
:
The official shall withhold blowing the whistle until A1 has either made or missed the shot. The official shall then sound the whistle and assess the Team B head coach or bench personnel with a technical foul. If the official judges the act to be flagrant, the offender shall be ejected. If A's coach or bench personnel was the offender, the whistle shall be sounded immediately when the unsporting act occurs. (10-5-1a)
STANDING BENCH Personnel

### 10.5.4 SITUATION A :

Late in the game, A1 has been replaced and returns to the bench. (a) Some team members of Team A rise to applaud A1; or (b) the coach of Team A rises and shakes hands with A1 as A1 leaves the court. In both cases the individuals are immediately seated.

**RULING:** 
There has been no violation of the bench conduct rule as it is specifically indicated that bench personnel may rise to acknowledge a replaced player. Displays of sporting behavior and fair play are to be encouraged and are clearly identifiable as such. If the state has adopted the optional coaching box, the head coach may remain standing. (10-5-4d, 10-6-1)

### 10.5.4 SITUATION B :

Team A coaches and substitutes are all standing during a free throw by A1. The infraction is detected by the officials. How many technical fouls are assessed?
RULING
:
In a situation where similar multiple infractions occur at the same time, it is not the intent of the rules to penalize each individual infraction as a separate technical foul. One technical foul is charged to Team A and it is also charged indirectly to the head coach in this situation, resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges.

### 10.5.4 SITUATION C :

Following a charged time-out the ball is bounced to A1 for a throw-in even though Team B is still gathered at the sideline. The substitutes are off the bench and the coaches are huddled around the seated players. Should Team B be charged with a technical foul(s) for substitutes and coaches being off the bench or outside the optional coaching box?
RULING
:
No. The resumption-of-play procedure takes precedence and no penalty is assessed for the other sideline infractions.
ENTERING COURT DURING FIGHT

### 10.5.5 SITUATION A :

Post-players A1 and B1 begin punching each other and play is stopped. Two substitutes from each team leave the bench area and come onto the court. The four substitutes: (a) do not become involved in the fight; (b) all become involved in the fight; (c) substitutes A6, A7 and B6 do not participate in the fight, but B7 becomes involved in the fight; (d) head coach and/or assistant coaches enters the court to assist in curtailing the fighting.
RULING
:
A1 and B1 are charged with flagrant fouls and are disqualified, but no free throws result from the double personal flagrant fouls. The four substitutes are charged with flagrant technical fouls and are disqualified. No free throws are awarded for the simultaneous technical fouls as the number of bench personnel leaving the bench and the penalties are the same for both teams. In (a), one technical foul is also charged indirectly

to the head coach of each team. In (b), each head coach is charged indirectly with two technical fouls (one for each bench player leaving the bench and becoming involved in the fight). In (c), the Team A head coach is charged indirectly with one technical foul and the Team B head coach is indirectly charged with two technical fouls (one for substitutes B6 and B7 leaving the bench, and one for B7 becoming involved in the fight). In situations (a), (b) and (c), the ball is put in play at the point of interruption. Legal in (d).

**COMMENT:** 
The head coach and any number of assistant coaches may enter the court in the situation where a fight may break out or has broken out to prevent the situation from escalating. This does not eliminate the obligation that the members of the coaching staff are responsible for the conduct of personnel on the bench in this type of situation. (4-36, 10-5-5 Note)

### 10.5.5 SITUATION B :

A fight breaks out between A1 and B1 during a dead-ball and clock-stopped situation. The head coach of Team A rushes onto the court. onents
:
A1 and B1 are charged with flagrant technical fouls and are disqualified. No free throws are awarded for the double technical foul by A1 and B1. Since the head coach is allowed on the court without being beckoned by an official when a fight occurs, that coach is not charged with a flagrant technical foul and would not be disqualified. Resume play using point of interruption. (4-36)

### 10.5.5 SITUATION C :

Substitutes A6, A7 and A8 enter the floor and fight with substitutes B6, B7 and B8. onents
:
A6, A7, A8, B6, B7 and B8 are charged with flagrant fouls and disqualified. Each head coach is charged with three indirect technical fouls and disqualified and must leave the vicinity or the playing area and have no further contact with the team. Because the substitute's fouls were offsetting, no free throws will be awarded. Charge each team with three fouls toward the bonus and resume play at the point of interruption.
Simultaneous technicals by opponents

### 10.5.5 SITUATION D :

While the ball is live, players A1 and B1 commit fouls against each other at approximately the same time. A1 then punches B1. B6 and B7 leave the confines of the bench but do not participate in the fight.

**RULING:** 
The common fouls by A1 and B1 constitute a double personal foul so no free throws are awarded. A1's punch constitutes fighting and results in a flagrant technical foul and disqualification, and two free throws are awarded. B6 and B7 are assessed technical fouls and disqualified for entering the court illegally during a fight. Although B6 and B7 are both assessed technical fouls, only one is penalized with two free throws. The coach is penalized one indirect technical foul for B6 and B7 leaving the bench. (4-19-8, 10-4-7, 10-7 Penalties (Rule 10 Summary) 8a, 10-7 Penalties 8b) Administration of Penalties: The double personal fouls offset and no free throws are awarded. With the marked free-throw lane spaces clear, any member of Team B (other than B6 and B7) attempts two free throws for the flagrant technical foul (fighting) by A1. These attempts are followed by any member of Team A (other than A1) attempting two free throws (with the marked free-throw lane spaces clear)

<!-- Page 90: Page 90 -->

for the technical foul charged to B6 and B7 for leaving the bench during a fight, but not participating. Following the free throw attempts by Team A, play is resumed with a throw-in by Team A at the division line opposite the scorer's table.

### 10.5.5 SITUATION E :

A1 and B1 begin fighting and play is stopped. Substitute A6 leaves the bench area and enters the court to observe. B6 also enters the court at the same time, but B6 actually participates in the fight.

**RULING:** 
A1, B1, A6 and B6 are all disqualified. No free throws result from the double flagrant foul by A1 and B1 or from the simultaneous technical fouls by A6 and B6. Each head coach is charged with one indirect technical foul resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. Play resumes at the point of interruption. (4-36, 10-4-8)

### 10.5.5 SITUATION F :

It appears a fight may occur on the playing court when (a) A6 and A7; or (b) A6 and B6 leave their respective benches.

**RULING:** 
In (a) and (b), all players leaving the bench are assessed flagrant fouls and disqualified. The respective head coach is assessed a maximum of one indirect technical foul (regardless of the number of players leaving the bench) resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. In (a), Team B is awarded two free throws and the ball for a division line throw-in. In (b), no free throws are awarded and the ball is put into play at the point of interruption. (4-36)
BENCH CONDUCT SITUATIONS

### 10.6.1 SITUATION A :

The coach of Team A leaves the bench area and goes to the table to seek information other than a correctable error, or a timing, scoring or alternating-possession mistake: (a) during a time-out; or (b) during the intermission between the first and second quarters.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), the official may warn the head coach unless the offense is judged to be major, in which case a technical foul is charged directly to the coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. If information is needed by the head coach, it must be secured by a manager or statistician. A coach is not permitted at the table for this purpose. To allow exceptions would open the door for exploitation and would result in situations which could not be enforced consistently.

### 10.6.1 SITUATION B :

The coach of Team B rises and accompanies B6 to the table to make sure the substitute reports properly.
RULING
:
The official may warn the head coach unless the offense is judged to be major, in which case a technical foul charged directly to the coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. The coach is not allowed to be off the bench or out of the optional coaching box for this purpose.
REPLACEMENT OF A DISQUALIFIED OR INJURED PLAYER

### 10.6.2 SITUATION A :

A1 has been injured and has received extensive medical attention on the court. The coach: (a) helps assist the injured player to the bench; or (b) remains at the bench area while A1 is treated and helped to the bench. How much time does the coach have to replace A1?
RULING
:
In both (a) and (b), the coach will have 15 seconds to replace the injured player. In (a), the 15 seconds should start after the coach can turn attention from the injured athlete to the duty

<!-- Page 91: Page 91 -->

of making a replacement. In (b), the 15 seconds would begin as soon as A1 has been returned to the bench. In both cases, the timer should be instructed by the official to sound a warning horn and start timing the 15 seconds and sound the horn to notify the official after 15 seconds have elapsed.

### 10.6.2 SITUATION B :

A1 has been disqualified from the game for committing a fifth foul or a flagrant foul. The coach of Team A is notified and then the official instructs the timer to begin the replacement period. The player is then notified of the disqualification. The coach of Team A rises from the bench and: (a) talks until the sounding of the warning horn with the four remaining players who have gathered near the boundary; (b) immediately sends A6 to the table to report in. The coach then gathers the players at the sideline for a conference; or (c) sends A6 toward the table but the warning horn indicates the 15 seconds have expired before A6 gets there.
RULING
:
Legal in (a), as long as a substitute reports before the 15 seconds have elapsed. In (b), play will resume as soon as A6 has reported to the scorer. In (c), a technical foul is charged directly to the coach.
10.6.3 SITUATION:
A5 has just received a fifth foul of the game. A5 (a) is erroneously permitted to remain in the game for another two minutes before the scorer realizes the mistake; or (b) leaves the game after the coach is notified of the disqualification. At the intermission between the third and fourth quarter, A5 reports as a substitute and subsequently enters the game.

**RULING:** 
In (a), as soon as the error is discovered, the player is removed from the game, no penalties are assessed. In (b), A5 will not actually "participate" until the ball becomes live. If detected prior to the ball becoming live, A5 would be directed to the bench and no penalty assessed unless the official deemed it was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the rules. If detected after the ball becomes live, it is a technical foul charged directly to the head coach resulting in the loss of coaching-box privileges. The player is immediately removed from the game and Team B is awarded two free throws and a division-line throw-in. (2-11-5 Note)
UNAUTHORIZED LEAVING OF THE BENCH AREA/PLAYING COURT

### 10.6.5 SITUATION A :

Airborne shooter A1 is fouled by B1 after the ball is released on the try. Playing time for the second quarter expires while the unsuccessful try is in flight. Since no players are required to line up for the free throws, Team B's head coach takes the team to the locker room to begin the intermission.

**RULING:** 
Team B's head coach is assessed a direct technical foul for permitting team members to leave the bench/court for an unauthorized reason. Even though no time remains on the game clock, the quarter doesn't end until A1's free throws are completed; therefore, the technical foul is part of the second quarter. A1 will attempt the two shooting-foul free throws followed by any Team A member attempting the two free throws for the technical foul. The Team B head coach has lost coaching-box privileges for the remainder of the game. The third quarter will begin with the alternating-possession procedure. (5-6-2 Exception 3)

<!-- Page 92: Page 92 -->


### 10.6.5 SITUATION B :

A spectator heckles Team A member, A9, while A9 is sitting on Team A's bench. A9 leaves the bench area and goes into the stands to confront the fan.

**RULING:** 
Team A's head coach is assessed a direct technical foul for permitting A9 to leave the bench area for an unauthorized reason. Team B is awarded two free throws and the ball for a division line throw-in. The Team A head coach has lost coaching-box privileges for the remainder of the game.
CONTACT

### 10.7.1 SITUATION A :

B1 takes a certain spot on the court before A1 jumps in the air to catch a pass: (a) A1 lands on B1; or (b) B1 moves to a new spot while A1 is airborne. A1 lands on one foot and then charges into B1.
RULING
:
In (a) and (b), the foul is on A1. (4-23-5d)

### 10.7.1 SITUATION B :

The bonus is in effect and while the ball is in flight during a try for a field goal by A1, A2 charges into B1. Following this there is a basket-interference violation by: (a) B2 or (b) A3.
RULING
:
In (a), both the foul by A2 and the violation by B2 are penalized, but in the reverse order of occurrence. Two points are first awarded to Team A because of the violation by B2. B1 is then awarded bonus free throws. Had the bonus not been in effect in (a), B would have been awarded the ball out of bounds at its end line where the basket was awarded. In (b), there are no rule complications. The violation by A3 caused the ball to become dead. Ordinarily, the ball would go to B out of bounds at one of the two designated spots along the end line nearest the violation. However, this penalty is ignored because of the penalty enforcement for the foul by A2. (7-5-7, 9-11 Penalty)

### 10.7.1 SITUATION C :

B1 is standing behind the plane of the backboard before A1 jumps for a lay-up shot. The forward momentum causes airborne shooter A1 to charge into B1.
RULING
:
B1 is entitled to the position obtained legally before A1 left the floor. If the ball goes through the basket before or after the contact occurs, the player-control foul cancels the goal. However, if B1 moves into the path of A1 after A1 has left the floor, the foul is on B1. B1's foul on the airborne shooter is a foul during the act of shooting. If the shot is successful, one free throw is awarded and if it is unsuccessful, two free throws result. (4-19-1, 4-19-6, 6-7-4, 10 Penalty 2, 10 Penalty 5a)

### 10.7.7 SITUATION A :

During congested play in the free-throw semi-circle, B1 and B2 are less than 3 feet apart when dribbler A1 fakes to one side and then causes contact in attempting to dribble between them.
RULING
:
Unless one of the defensive players is faked out of position to permit adequate space for the dribbler to go between without making contact, it is a player-control foul on A1.

### 10.7.7 SITUATION B :

A1 is dribbling in a line down the center of the floor.
B1 is running more than two steps behind A1 and in a line between the side of the lane and the sideline.
A1 veers to the side to try and cut off B1 and create contact.
If B1 remains behind and collides with A1, how should the official determine the fouling player?

**RULING:** 
Screening principles apply to the dribbler who attempts

<!-- Page 93: Page 93 -->

to cut off an opponent who is approaching in a different path from the rear. In this case, the dribbler must allow such opponent a maximum of two steps or an opportunity to stop or avoid contact. When both the dribbler and the opponent are moving in exactly the same path and same direction, the player behind is responsible for contact which results if the player in front slows down or stops. (4-7-2)
10.7.9 SITUATION:
Dribbler A1 has established a straight-line path toward a certain area of the court. Can A1 maintain this specific path?

**RULING:** 
Only to the extent that no opponent who is behind or to the side can crowd A1 out of this path. Opponents may attempt to obtain a legal guarding position in A1's path at any time. To obtain an initial legal guarding position, both feet of the guard must be on the court and the guard must be facing the dribbler prior to contact. Time and distance are not factors in obtaining an initial guarding position on an opponent with the ball. Once legal position is obtained, the guard can move to maintain position in the dribbler's path. The requirement of having two feet on the court does not apply in maintaining a legal guarding position, provided the guard maintains inbounds status. (4-23)

### 10.7.11 SITUATION A :

A1 holds the ball near the center of the court. A2 is on the right side of the basket and closely guarded by B1. A3 moves to a position behind B1, after which A2 circles B1 and receives a pass on the left side of the basket and scores.
RULING
:
Legal goal unless there was contact and responsibility for it is charged to A3. This will depend on whether A3 took a position at such distance as to permit B1 one step space for normal movement without making contact. (4-40)

### 10.7.11 SITUATION B :

A1, in attempting to screen, takes a stationary position in the path of moving B1. The position of A1: (a) is less than one normal step away and B1 cannot avoid A1 and contact results; or (b) is more than two steps away so that B1, who is aware of the position of A1, has an opportunity to avoid A1 but contact still results.
RULING
:
In (a), the foul is on A1 for blocking. In (b), B1 did not use the opportunity to avoid A1 and, therefore, is responsible for the contact and is charged with the foul. (4-40)

### 10.7.11 SITUATION C :

A defensive player takes a position in front of the post player A1 to prevent A1 from receiving the ball. A high pass is made over the head and out of reach of the defensive player. The post player A1 moves toward the basket to catch the pass and try for goal. As the pass is made, a teammate of the defensive player moves into the path of A1, in a guarding position. What are the rights of the pivot player A1 and the defensive player who moves into A1's path?
RULING
:
The defensive player has switched to guard a player who does not have the ball. Therefore, the switching player must assume a position one or two strides in advance of the post player (depending upon the speed of movement of such player) to make the action legal. If the defensive player moves into the path of the post player A1 after A1 has control of the ball (provided the post player is not in the air at the time), the play becomes a guarding situation on a player with the ball and no distance or time limit is involved. (4-40)

<!-- Page 94: Page 94 -->


### 10.7.11 SITUATION D :

A1 is running toward A's goal but is looking back to receive a pass. B1 takes a position in the path of A1 while A1 is 10 feet away from B1. (a) A1 runs into B1 before receiving the ball; or (b) A1 receives the ball and before taking a step contacts B1.
RULING
:
In both (a) and (b), A1 is responsible for contact. In (a), B1's position is legal if A1 has been given two strides prior to contact. In (b), since the position of B1 is legal when A1 has the ball, the contact is a player-control foul by A1. (4-40)

### 10.7.12 SITUATION A :

A1 is dribbling in the frontcourt and B1 (a) places two hands on the dribbler; (b) places an extended arm bar on the dribbler; (c) places and keeps a hand on the dribbler; (d) contacts the dribbler more than once with the same hand or alternating hands.

**RULING:** 
Illegal in all cases. A personal foul shall be ruled any time this type of contact occurs on a player holding or dribbling the ball.

### 10.7.12 SITUATION B :

A1 receives a pass in the free-throw lane. B1 (a) places two hands on the dribbler; (b) places an extended arm bar on the dribbler; (c) places and keeps a hand on the dribbler; (d) contacts the dribbler more than once with the same hand or alternating hands.

**RULING:** 
Illegal in all cases. A personal foul shall be ruled any time this type of contact occurs on a player holding or dribbling the ball.
